The professional restaurant critic can take even the most dismal dining experience and turn it into digestible fodder for readers. In fact, it\'92s those baffling, disappointing, and downright bad meals that often make for the most entertaining reads.\
Per annual Eater tradition, here\'92s a look at the best of what critics had to say about the worst restaurant experiences. In keeping with the spirit of 2017,\'a0
\b reviews were about more than unfortunate food on a plate
\b0 . This year\'92s crop of beleaguered critics asked big questions: Should a supposed hero of the working class charge $7 for a hot dog? How does the highest-grossing restaurant group get away with its culturally appropriative decor? And is this restaurant racist?\
For attempts at the answers \'97 plus expertly barbed descriptions of some really terrible food \'97 read on.\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Besha Rodell at Tao, Los Angeles\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs36 \cf6 \cb3 Former\'a0
\i LA Weekly
\i0 \'a0critic\cf2 \cb3 \'a0Besha Rodell set out to understand Tao, the massively successful New York-based mini chain. She wanted to know how a place that serves expensive, mediocre food and \'93blithely offers bottle service under a giant, reclining Buddha statue as paintings of demure geishas cast their eyes alluringly downward behind the bar\'94 could be the highest-grossing restaurant in America.\
But, failing to reach that understanding, and faced with unexpectedly bad food, what else was Rodell to to do but write a\'a0\cf6 \cb3 zero-star takedown\cf2 \cb3 ? Instead of \'93expensive, decent, Americanized versions of Chinese and Japanese classics,\'94 she dined on \'93dumpling skins so thick and glutinous that eating them was a little like biting into semi-coagulated library paste.\'94 Uni was of \'93the wan, dull-colored variety that you find in small-town, landlocked sushi bars, its creaminess turning to liquid, its oceanic pungent flavor edging on acridity.\'94 America, she concludes, deserves better.\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 For the kill:\'a0
\b0 \'93The food isn\'92t that much worse than what\'92s available at any number of popular chain restaurants, from the higher end through fast food (though I would much rather eat the orange chicken at P.F. Chang\'92s or Panda Express than the orange chicken at Tao).\'94\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Jay Rayner at Le Cinq, Paris\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\i\fs36 \cf2 Guardian
\i0 \'a0critic Jay Rayner is famously biting, but a trip to Le Cinq in Paris inspired\'a0\cf6 \cb3 a takedown\cf2 \cb3 \'a0that nearly sparked international conflict. The very fancy, Michelin-starred restaurant did nothing right, from the decor (\'93It is decorated in various shades of taupe, biscuit, and fuck you\'94) to the food (\'93A main of pigeon is requested medium, but served so pink it just might fly again given a few volts\'94) to the service (\'93There is only one thing worse than being served a terrible meal: being served a terrible meal by earnest waiters who have no idea just how awful the things they are doing to you are\'94). The French were\'a0\cf6 \cb3 not pleased\cf2 \cb3 .\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Ryan Sutton at Public Kitchen, New York\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs36 \cf2 Eater NY senior critic Ryan Sutton declared Jean-Georges Vongerichten\'92s Public Kitchen\'a0\cf6 \cb3 New York City\'92s worst new restaurant\cf2 \cb3 \'a0in a zero-star review with all the requisite one-liners. Although Sutton notes a bad meal at a restaurant in Vongerichten\'92s international empire isn\'92t out of the ordinary, he describes the mystifyingly buzzy Public Kitchen as nothing more than a \'93generically bad hotel restaurant.\'94\
Take, for example, the black truffle pizza, a Vongerichten staple. At Public, \'93the kitchen charred the exterior crust to a carbonic black, while the interior drooped flaccidly. The signature fungi paste, in turn, exhibited the color and texture of wet mud.\'94 Service doesn\'92t make up for it. Sutton writes, \'93The staff at Public find a way to make the concessioners at Yankee Stadium look four-star by comparison.\'94\

\b For the kill:\'a0
\b0 \'93Even Manhattan clam chowder, the accompaniment to grilled salmon (ordered medium rare, delivered medium well), turns out not to be actual soup, but a thin, saccharine, barely spoonable sauce of tomato and chile oil; it\'92s precisely the type of liquid one might expect to find scrapped off the side of a hot steel buffet.\'94\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Pete Wells at Locol, Oakland\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs36 \cf2 Some reviews only become scathing with context. In the early days of 2017, Pete Wells dropped a\'a0\cf6 \cb3 goose egg on Locol\cf2 \cb3 , the mission-driven fast-food restaurant from chefs Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi. The New York-based\'a0
\i New York Times\'a0
\i0 dining critic traveled all the way to Oakland to critique the second location of Locol, whose aim is to create jobs and serve healthier fast food to communities that need it.\
Wells, who typically reviews fine dining or casual chef-driven spots, was especially displeased with the chicken: \'93Inside a thin sheath of fried coating, this composite of ground meat is mysteriously bland and almost unimaginably dry,\'94 he writes. \'93It can be had as a single patty between buns with coleslaw, as the Fried Chicken Burg, or in a paper cup, with barbecue sauce, as bite-size Chicken Nugs. But the best thing to do with it is pretend it doesn\'92t exist.\'94\
Many thought the review was\'a0\cf6 \cb3 unfairly harsh\cf2 \cb3 , and\'a0\cf6 \cb3 internet backlash\cf2 \cb3 \'a0was swift. (The Oakland location Wells reviewed\'a0\cf6 \cb3 ended up closing in June\cf2 \cb3 .)\

\b For the kill:
\b0 \'a0\'93Mr. Patterson and Mr. Choi seem to have thought about the social dimensions of fast food so much that they now see their target audience as problems to be solved, not customers to be pleased. The most nutritious burger on earth won\'92t help you if you don\'92t want to eat it.\'94\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Tom Perkins at Made in Detroit, Detroit\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs36 \cf2 The fact that a restaurant from rap-rock star Kid Rock was the subject of a negative review should come as no surprise, but Tom Perkins\'92s problems with Made in Detroit run deep. In the\'a0
\i Detroit Metro Times
\i0 ,\'a0\cf6 \cb3 he writes\cf2 \cb3 \'a0that he can \'93forgive that the House-Brined Wings that arrive wet with the \'91Detroit honey hot sauce\'92 are a good pick on paper, but leave you searching for the \'91honey and hot\'92 through the wall of sodium.\'94 The American goulash, a $16 \'93sub-average dish of glorified Hamburger Helper that crackles with sodium,\'94 also gets a pass, as do \'93flavorless Brussels sprouts\'94 and the Hamtramck burger, a \'93mostly meaty and mushy\'94 sandwich that \'93seems to absorb any discernible flavor outside of the omnipresent sodium.\'94 But Perkins can\'92t forgive the prices.\

\b For the kill:
\b0 \'a0\'93Really, there\'92s no serious crime at Kid Rock\'92s Made In Detroit beyond the price point... That\'92s a bit odd since Ritchie bills himself as a working-class hero.\'94\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Lesley Chesterman at Bar George, Montreal\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs36 \cf2 Lesley Chesterman began her meal at Bar George, a British restaurant in a historic Montreal building, with a cocktail that was \'93pretty to look at\'94 but \'93sadly fell as flat as that Tom Cruise\'a0
\i Mummy
\i0 \'a0movie.\'94 The drink, she writes in a\'a0\cf6 \cb3 zero-star\'a0
\i Montreal Gazette
\i0 \'a0review\cf2 \cb3 , turned out to be a metaphor for the meal to come. The menu was \'93gimmicky,\'94 a cream of mushroom soup \'93didn\'92t taste a bit of mushroom,\'94 and a terrine of pork hock had a \'93salt problem\'94 that \'93marred the entire round of main courses.\'94 Dessert wasn\'92t any better: \'93A suet-based roly-poly cake topped with sea buckthorn berries and clotted cream was the worst dessert I\'92ve tasted in eons,\'94 Chesterman says. \'93I pushed the plate away after just one salty, pasty bite.\'94\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\b \cf2 \cb3 For the kill:
\b0 \'a0\'93The website describes the restaurant as \'91a modern-day rendezvous, cooking classic U.K. fare, slapped with Qu\'e9b\'e9cois cheek.\'92 Why put a label on it? Why not just make good food? Especially in June, when hearty British dishes are about as appropriate as a tweed overcoat.\'94\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Brian Reinhart at Hot Joy, Dallas\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\fs36 \cf2 Brian Reinhart didn\'92t intend for his\'a0\cf6 \cb3 review of Hot Joy\cf2 \cb3 \'a0to be a commentary on cultural appropriation, but upon visiting, the\'a0
\i Dallas Observer
\i0 \'a0critic realized that Hot Joy\'92s biggest problem wasn\'92t its food (although that was certainly a problem), but race: \'93Hot Joy is a clueless white-dude fantasy in which Asian identity and cuisine are reduced to a string of ironic clich\'e9s.\'94 These clich\'e9s take the form of a \'93fetishistic interior\'94 and a jumbled menu of every \'93East Asian food that\'92s middlebrow-approved,\'94 and the food doesn\'92t even live up to the stereotypes.\
\'93Its foods billed as spicy and funky, are instead sweetened and tamed,\'94 Reinhart writes. \'93I\'92ve suffered through herby pad Thai suffocating under a thick gloopy sweet sauce about as spicy as plain yogurt.\'94 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Hot Joy is\'a0\cf6 \cb3 now closed\cf2 \cb3 .\

\b For the kill:\'a0
\b0 \'93If Hot Joy\'92s attitude shows a shallow respect for Asia, its haphazard cooking betrays the kind of overconfidence that grows from ignorance.\'94\

\f0\fs37\fsmilli18750 \cf2 Honorable Mentions:\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl420\sa288\partightenfactor0

\f1\b\fs36 \cf6 \cb3 Bethany Jean Clement at Bulletproof Coffee, Seattle
\b0 \cf2 \cb3 : In a review of Seattle\'92s first Bulletproof cafe for the\'a0
\i Seattle Times
\i0 , columnist Bethany Jean Clement makes it hilariously clear she\'92s not buying into the cult. At the Seattle cafe, the allegedly brain-enhancing, butter-infused coffee is bad, but the food \'97 rubbery deviled eggs and a breakfast burrito, \'93which they\'92ll heat up for you if you like\'94 \'97 is worse.\'a0
\b For the kill:
\b0 \'a0\'93With the exception of the wan porkiness of the bites that include floppy bits of uncured bacon, it\'92s more of a textural experience than a taste sensation, like eating a gummy, tasteless cloud.\'94\

\b \cf6 \cb3 Craig LaBan at Scarpetta, Philadelphia
\b0 \cf2 \cb3 :
\b \'a0
\i\b0 Philadelphia Inquirer\'a0
\i0 critic Craig LaBan skewers Scarpetta\'92s Philly debut in a one-star review. The clientele generated \'93an unexpected fog of body sweat, cleaning fluid, and strong cologne,\'94 the servers offered \'93overeager-to-please enthusiasm,\'94 and several of the entrees \'93were served less than hot for $30-plus a plate.\'94\'a0
\b For the kill:
\b0 \'a0\'93It was a kind of generic pomp more typical of casino cooking, where seemingly every dish is plated as a little tower, piled high and glossed with stock.\'94\

\b \cf6 \cb3 Gretchen Kurtz at French 75, Denver
\b0 \cf2 \cb3 :
\b \'a0
\b0 During critic Gretchen Kurtz\'92s disappointing meal at Denver restaurant French 75, which she recounted for\'a0
\i Westword
\i0 , nothing was great, but the desserts took the cake. \'93Pastry that should\'92ve been light and airy yet sturdy enough to hold ice cream had the texture of stale baguette,\'94 Kurtz writes.\'a0
\b For the kill:\'a0
\b0 \'93Three months in, the tables are already so scuffed they look greasy. The bathrooms are down so many empty corridors, you get the creeps finding your way alone at night. Servers might tell you that the dessert menu is a postcard they\'92ll mail for you, but that\'92s if they even remember to bring the dessert menu in the first place.\'94\

\b \cf6 \cb3 Jay Rayner at Fancy Crab, London
\b0 \cf2 \cb3 :
\b \'a0
\b0 Rayner is the snarkiest version of himself in a\'a0
\i Guardian\'a0
\i0 review of pricey king crab-themed restaurant Fancy Crab. According to the critic, Fancy Crab is \'93a crab restaurant for recently married couples who hope they\'92ll get divorced before they ever reach the companionable stage in which one of them brushes their teeth while the other has a pee.\'94
\b \'a0For the kill:
\b0 \'a0\'93Fancy Crab isn\'92t good. It\'92s a terrible waste of their money and our money and everybody\'92s time.\'94\

\b \cf6 \cb3 Brandon Watson at El Burro, Austin
\b0 \cf2 \cb3 :
\b \'a0
\i\b0 Austin Chronicle
\i0 \'a0critic Brandon Watson wonders why El Burro exists. The Tex-Mex restaurant serves queso with the \'93artificial tang and plastic texture of a Kraft single\'94 and queso fundido consisting of \'93purulent clumps of cheese drowned in an eighth of an inch of oil, as if they poured the bacon \'97 grease and all \'97 straight from the frying pan.\'94\'a0
\b For the kill:
\b0 \'93Everything about El Burro feels like a defeated shrug. In a town where some of our Tex-Mex institutions are failing, it seems particularly egregious to replace heritage with hologram.\'94\

\b \cf6 \cb3 The Infatuation LA at Vespertine, LA
\b0 \cf2 \cb3 : In a restaurant review for these times, the Infatuation LA editors used Instagram stories to chronicle their experience at tasting-menu sensation Vespertine (before being yelled at by Vespertine staff for their phone use and for infuriating \'93the space emperor\'94 chef Jordan Kahn). They commented on the space (\'93outer space is pretty\'94) and the food (\'93oh look we can eat a tree\'94), and concluded that Vespertine is \'93complete and utter garbage.\'94\'a0
\b For the kill:\'a0
\b0 \'93It\'92s a miserable, dark trap.\'94}
