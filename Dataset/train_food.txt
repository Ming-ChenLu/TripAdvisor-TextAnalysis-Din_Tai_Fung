\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 Taiwanese Food Guide: 57 Things to Eat in Taiwan and Where to Try Them
\b0\fs26 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This post has been almost four years in the making.\cb1 \
\cb3 When we first went to Taiwan in 2014, it was a spur of the moment trip. We spent just three days in Taipei thinking it would be enough time to spend in a city we didn\'92t know much about and never really planned on visiting. But those three days changed us. We weren\'92t expecting to fall in love with Taiwan, but we did. Madly. So much so that we now want to move there. We fell in love with Taipei, we fell in love with its warm people, we fell in love with the vibe, and of course, we fell in love with the food.\cb1 \
\cb3 After spending just three days in Taiwan, the most I could include in my first Taiwanese food post was a paltry nine dishes. Knowing the wealth of street food and night markets in Taiwan, I understood it was a pathetic list. It\'92s lack of depth has been eating at me ever since and I\'92ve been dying to come back to Taiwan to explore more of the country and come up with a better, more comprehensive list. Nearly four years later, this is that list.\cb1 \

\f0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 We spent a full two weeks eating our way through Taiwan and it\'92s many night markets. We visited {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/06/02/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-taichung-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Taichung}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/26/explore-sun-moon-lake-on-a-day-trip-from-taichung-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Sun Moon Lake}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/10/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-tainan-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Tainan}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/21/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-kaohsiung-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Kaohsiung}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/11/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-hualien-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Hualien}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/05/beitou-and-tamsui-an-easy-day-trip-from-taipei-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Tamsui}}, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/29/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-shifen-jiufen-in-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Jiufen}}, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/25/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-taipei-taiwan-2018/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Taipei}}. We tried as many dishes as we could and in the process reconfirmed what we had learned almost four years ago \'96 Taiwan is an enchanting country with a rich, vibrant, and storied food culture. If you travel for food like we do and are wondering what dishes you can find in Taiwan, then I hope this guide can help you plan your trip.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\i\b \cf2 \cb3 NOTE:
\i0\b0  Under each listing in this guide are suggestions on where to try that dish. I\'92ll be coming up with multiple posts with more information on each of these restaurants and night markets. It\'92ll take me several weeks so if there\'92s anything you\'92d like to know now, then please post a question in the comments. I usually respond right away. Happy traveleating!\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 1. Ah-gei\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Ah-gei is a specialty of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Tamsui}} in New Taipei City. It\'92s a dish we actively sought out when we spent a day there. Little did we know that we\'92d randomly walk into the place that invented it!\cb1 \
\cb3 Ah-gei consists of fried tofu skin stuffed with cooked green bean noodles and sealed with surimi, a fish paste mixture commonly sold in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/05/beitou-and-tamsui-an-easy-day-trip-from-taipei-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Tamsui District}}. It was invented by the Original Ah-Gei shop in 1965 where they\'92ve kept the recipe unchanged for over 50 years. Still considered by many to be the best and most authentic, what sets them apart is that they combine surimi with a carrot mixture and cook the stuffed tofu in stewed ground pork to make it even more flavorful.\cb1 \
\cb3 We had the ah-gei pictured below at Three Sisters Ah-Gei, which is just a few doors down from the Original Ah-Gei shop. Personally, we couldn\'92t really tell the difference between the two and enjoyed both equally. Along with Wenhua Ah-Gei, these three shops \'96 which are practically next to each other in the same alley \'96 are said to offer the best ah-gei in town. A must-try when in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul \ulc4 Tamsui}}.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 2. Baobing\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Yes, this mound of golden mango goodness was every bit as delicious as it looks. Baobing is a shaved ice dessert topped with condensed milk and a variety of ingredients like fruit, ice cream, taro, azuki beans, sweet potato chunks, peanuts, and grass jelly. In Taiwan, because of the quality of their fruit, one of the most popular flavors is mango.\cb1 \
\cb3 Gao Xiong Po Po Shaved Ice in Kaohsiung serves a mean mango baobing. It\'92s topped with mango syrup, mango ice cream, and fist-sized hunks of sweet nectar-y mango. We had this after walking around in the hot Kaohsiung sun and it blew our minds. It was so naturally sweet and delicious! Looking at this list now, if there were just one dish I could have again, then it would be this mango baobing. It\'92s so damn good.\cb1 \
\cb3 We didn\'92t try it but there\'92s a variation of baobing called xue hua bing. It\'92s basically the same thing but instead of crushed bits of ice, it\'92s made with sheets of frozen condensed milk. Something like Korean bingsu I guess.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 3. Baozi\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Baozi are basically mantou or Chinese steamed buns filled with a variety of ingredients like meat and vegetables. They can be savory or sweet and are typically eaten for breakfast or as snacks. There are many varieties of baozi that differ in preparation and fillings, some of the most popular being \cf4 \ul \ulc4 xiao long bao\cf2 \ulnone  and \cf4 \ul sheng jian bao\cf2 \ulnone , among others.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 \cb3 You can find different types of baozi throughout Taiwan. We enjoyed these soupy pork and green onion buns at the often recommended {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/11/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-hualien-taiwan/#gongzheng-baozi"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Gongzheng Baozi eatery in Hualien}}. Served with a homemade garlic dip, they\'92re filling and cheap, just NTD 50 for a basket of ten. We came here after a full lunch at \cf4 \ul Mr. Goose\cf2 \ulnone  so I didn\'92t think we could get through all ten, but we did rather easily. They weren\'92t as soup-filled as we were expecting but they were very tasty. That garlic dip is delicious!\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 4. Beef Noodle Soup\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Beef noodle soup is arguably the most beloved comfort dish in Taiwan. It consists of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_noodle_soup"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul red-braised beef}} slow-cooked in soy sauce, beef broth, vegetables, and Chinese wheat noodles. So important is beef noodle soup that it\'92s often regarded as Taiwan\'92s national dish. In fact, a beef noodle festival is held in Taipei every year where chefs and restaurants compete for the title of \'93best beef noodles\'94 in Taiwan.\cb1 \
\cb3 You can find beef noodle soup anywhere in the country but two highly regarded places are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/03/taipei-food-guide-13-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taipei-taiwan/#tao-yuan-street-beef-noodle-shop"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tao-Yuan Street Beef Noodle Shop in Taipei}} and Gang Yuan Beef Noodles in Kaohsiung. Both were excellent, though the latter may have been slightly better as their noodles seemed springier in texture. Regardless, both restaurants are must-visits and hugely popular so be prepared for a wait. The bowls pictured below are from Gang Yuan Beef Noodles where you can choose between a wet and dry version.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 5. Braised Pork Knuckles\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 I\'92ve eaten \cf4 \ul lu rou fan (braised pork rice)\cf2 \ulnone  at several restaurants in Taiwan, and braised pork knuckles was often on the menu. Not surprising I guess since they\'92re similar in taste and preparation. Both are slow cooked for hours until fork tender, with the main difference being the pig parts used. Instead of pork hocks, lu rou fan uses pork belly. I like both dishes though I may prefer braised pork knuckles because of its gelatinous texture.\cb1 \
\cb3 We had this delicious plate of braised pork knuckles at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/30/taichung-food-guide-9-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taichung-taiwan/#fu-din-wang"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Fu Ding Wang in Taichung}}. They\'92re known for their braised pork knuckles and lu rou fan so we ordered both. So should you.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 6. Braised Pork Rice (Lu Rou Fan)\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is one of Taiwan\'92s most beloved comfort dishes, perhaps second only to \cf4 \ul beef noodle soup\cf2 \ulnone . It\'92s a dish of minced pork belly that\'92s been stir-fried and slow cooked in soy sauce until fall-apart tender. It\'92s then served atop a bowl of steamed rice, often with a side of hardboiled egg that\'92s been simmered in the same soy sauce mixture.\cb1 \
\cb3 I\'92m a rice person so I preferred lu rou fan over beef noodle soup. We had it at Fu Ding Wang in Taichung and the ultra popular {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/03/taipei-food-guide-13-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taipei-taiwan/#jin-feng-lu-rou-fan"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jin Feng in Taipei}}. Both were fantastic. Sweet and savory with a thick sauce, the bits of pork belly are so tender they practically disintegrate in your mouth. It\'92s a comforting dish indeed and something I could see myself eating everyday.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 7. Bubble Tea (Boba)\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Also known as boba or pearl milk tea, bubble tea is a massively popular Taiwanese drink that\'92s become well-known in many parts of the world as well. You see it everywhere in Taiwan. In fact, you\'92ll even see stores selling bubble tea holders so you can walk around looking lit with a cup of boba slung over your shoulders.\cb1 \
\cb3 Looking at the menus of bubble tea stands, you\'92ll find a head-spinning number of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_tea"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul bubble tea varieties}}. Some are made with milk, some with fruit juice. You can get it either hot or cold and with any number of add-ons like tapioca pearls, pudding, and fruit jellies. You can even specify your desired level of sweetness. The choices seem endless so to keep things simple, I always go with the original which is pearl milk tea. It\'92s black tea, milk, sugar, and tapioca pearls. That\'92s it. Apparently, it\'92s still the most popular and with good reason. It\'92s refreshing and delicious.\cb1 \
\cb3 I was under the impression that Chun Shui Tang, a tea house originally from Taichung, was the inventor of bubble tea. We had it at their original store in Taichung (pictured up top). But as it turns out, Hanlin teahouse from Tainan may have a claim to that title as well. We may never know which teahouse truly invented bubble tea, but one thing\'92s for sure, it\'92s something you need to have at least once on every return trip to Taiwan. It\'92s about as Taiwanese as Taipei 101.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 8. Bubble Tea Toast\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is perhaps one of the oddest dishes on this list. Available at one {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#ruifeng-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Ruifeng Night Market}} stall in Kaohsiung, bubble tea toast is basically boba in grilled sandwich form!\cb1 \
\cb3 A sweet milk tea spread is slathered over two slices of white bread and filled with a generous helping of tapioca pearls before being toasted and sealed in a sandwich maker. Like a \cf4 \ul peanut ice cream roll with cilantro\cf2 \ulnone  or a Filipino ice cream sandwich, it sort of blurs the line between a savory snack and a dessert. Confusing to some, I didn\'92t mind it at all but Ren hated it. \cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 9. Coffee Nougat Biscuit\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 We learned about this bite-sized biscuit while on a Kkday tour of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/26/10-things-to-eat-on-jiufen-old-street-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}. Our tour guide hyped it up as a delicious snack that even her son loved. Thinking how she may be getting paid to take us there, I wouldn\'92t have believed her had I not tasted it myself. I\'92m not usually fond of snacks like this, but these coffee nougat biscuits from the Saint Peter shop are damn delicious. They\'92re chewy and not too sweet with a robust coffee flavor.\cb1 \
\cb3 Thankfully, you don\'92t have to go all the way to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/29/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-shifen-jiufen-in-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}} to get a box. We chanced upon a branch in the Ximending area of Taipei. Based on their {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.facebook.com/SaintPeterNougat/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Facebook page}}, it looks like they have other branches as well, including one in Tamsui.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 10. Coffin Bread\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 When I was doing research for our trip, I came across this intriguing sounding dish described as a \'93night market specialty of Tainan and Taipei since the 1940s\'94. Coffin bread is basically a thick hunk of fried bread that\'92s been hollowed out and filled with a creamy chicken, seafood, or vegetable chowder. As you can see below, it really does resemble a coffin.\cb1 \
\cb3 The one we had along {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#anping-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Anping Old Street in Tainan}} was made with chicken and it reminded me of chicken pot pie or chicken ala king served in a crunchy, bread-y vessel. It was hearty and satisfying.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 11. Crispy Almond Pork Paper\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Crispy almond pork paper, or pork paper for short, is a snack made with pork and almonds hammered out into thin, paper-like sheets. Crisp and delicate, it tastes like a savory and sweet potato crisp. It\'92s a delicious and highly addictive snack. So addictive in fact, that Ren went through an entire pack in just one sitting!\cb1 \
\cb3 We bought four packs in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tamsui}} but you can get these throughout Taiwan \'96 at night markets, souvenir snack shops, even at the airport. People will recommend \cf4 \ul pineapple cakes\cf2 \ulnone  or \cf4 \ul sun cakes\cf2 \ulnone , but if I were to bring back just one souvenir food item from Taiwan, then this would be it. It\'92s so tasty and easy to eat that it really is quite addictive.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 12. Danzai Noodles\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Danzai noodles are a specialty of Tainan. It consists of chewy wheat-based noodles in a meat and seafood broth topped with long-simmered pork and a ceremonial piece of shrimp. Also known as \'93slack-season noodle soup,\'94 it was created by southern Taiwanese fishermen over 130 years ago. They\'92d carry wooden poles (danzai) with suspended pots over their shoulders, peddling noodles instead of fresh seafood during the off- or \'93slack\'94 season.\cb1 \
\cb3 We tried it at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/10/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-tainan-taiwan/#du-hsiao-yueh"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Du Hsiao Yueh}}, a restaurant in Tainan that\'92s been specializing in this dish since 1895. That\'92s over 123 years! They offer a wet and dry version, both of which were very good. You can\'92t tell from this picture but the bowls of danzai noodles are fairly small. Even Ren with her miniscule appetite wanted more. As it turns out, this is the normal serving size for danzai noodles since they\'92re considered more of a snack than an entree.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 13. Deep-Fried Battered Seafood\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 You\'92ll find stalls selling deep-fried battered seafood in virtually every night market in Taiwan. It\'92s delicious and easy to eat, even while walking. They make them with different types of seafood like shrimp and crab, but my favorite by far is the squid. You can get it topped with a variety of seasonings but I always got mine with lime salt. It\'92s crunchy, salty, a little sour, and still tender, in spite of the squid\'92s size.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 14. DIY Grilled Shrimp\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This was one of the most fun meals we\'92ve had in Taiwan. There\'92s a popular pastime here called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2014/10/27/we-be-shrimpin-in-taipei/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul urban shrimping}}. People would cast fishing lines into concrete indoor pools filled with live freshwater shrimp. Any shrimp you catch you would then skewer, salt, and grill yourself on the premises. It\'92s just grilled shrimp with salt but catching them yourself is half the fun.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 15. Duck\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Peking duck, roast duck, crispy fried duck. I don\'92t think I\'92ve ever met a duck I didn\'92t like. It\'92s always juicy and way more flavorful than chicken.\cb1 \
\cb3 I learned about this duck specialty restaurant in Kaohsiung called Duck (Ya Rou) Zhen when I chanced upon an article from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://guide.michelin.sg/en/insider-guide-taiwan-11-eats-to-discover-in-kaohsiung-and-tainan"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Singapore Michelin Guide}}. In it, Chef Lanshu Chen of Le Mout describes her favorite places to eat in Tainan and Kaohsiung, proclaiming Ya Rou Zhen as her go-to place for duck. There she orders sliced duck with some rice and a bowl of duck innards soup. Being the head chef of one of the world\'92s best restaurants, she clearly knows what she\'92s talking about so I followed her lead, dish for dish, and it was awesome.\cb1 \
\cb3 Tender, juicy, and smokey with a nice layer of fat beneath the skin, the sliced duck was delicious. Even then, what stole the show was the innards soup. Swimming with duck parts like intestine, liver, and gizzard, it was clean and flavorful with that wonderful gummy texture characteristic of offal. Serious yum!\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 16. Fish Balls (Skewered)\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Fish balls are a staple street food in many Asian countries and Taiwan is no exception. I did some research and in Taiwan, it looks like they often use milkfish as the main ingredient. Sold at many night markets, the fish balls are left stewing in sauce before being skewered and served. At this particular {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#ruifeng-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Ruifeng Night Market}} stall in Kaohsiung, they offered fish balls simmering in three different sauces, one of which was a robust spicy curry. Be sure to try that one.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Aside from skewered curry fish balls, you\'92ll often find them in soup as well. Throughout Taiwan we found stalls and restaurants offering fish balls, squid balls, and meat balls bobbing up and down in bowls of clear soup. Pictured below is a bowl of fish ball soup from the \cf4 \ul Original Ah-Gei Shop in Tamsui\cf2 \ulnone . The oblong-shaped fish balls are made daily and boast a springy texture. Being next to the ocean, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tamsui}} is known for their fish balls so be sure to try a bowl there. Neighborhood rival Three Sisters Ah-Gei makes a mean fish ball soup as well.\cb1 \

I don\'92t know what they\'92re made of but they come in different sizes and shades of earthy colors. They appear to be a mix of fish, pork, squid, and vegetable. They\'92re hearty and fun to eat.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 18. Flame-Torched Beef\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is one of my favorite things to eat at Taiwanese night markets. Tender cubes of beef are cooked over a grill before being torched and sprinkled with your choice of seasoning like salt, pepper, teriyaki, or cumin. It\'92s simple but oh so good. The torching of the beef makes for a good show too.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 19. Fried Chicken Chop\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is one of the most iconic dishes at Taiwanese night markets. Led by the uber popular {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.hotstar.com.tw/EN/home/Default.asp"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Hot Star}}, chicken cutlets the size of your face are dredged in flour and deep-fried to golden perfection. Like many \cf4 \ul deep-fried dishes\cf2 \ulnone , you\'92ll be given your choice of seasoning like salt and pepper, chili pepper, sweet and sour, or teriyaki.\cb1 \
\cb3 You\'92ll find many stalls offering fried chicken chops at night markets but the Hot Star brand is the most well-known. In spite of its hefty size, the chicken meat is surprisingly tender.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 20. Glutinous Rice Cake\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is one of the most interesting things we\'92ve eaten so far in Taiwan. It\'92s a Hakka glutinous rice cake that comes with a variety of fillings like sweet red bean, salted vegetable, and preserved turnip. Hakka cuisine is the cooking style of the Hakka people who are originally from China.\cb1 \
\cb3 Several stalls sell these glutinous rice cakes in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/26/10-things-to-eat-on-jiufen-old-street-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}, but none are more popular than Ah Lan Hakka Glutinous Rice Cake. They\'92re easy to spot. Just look for the stall with the longest queue. It\'92s one of, if not the most famous stall in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#jiufen-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 I think the one we got contained preserved turnip. It was an odd and overpowering flavor which took me by surprise at first. Because of the glutinous rice casing, I was expecting to find something sweet inside, like a mildly flavored dessert. Instead, I got a pungent and salty vegetable flavor! It\'92s an acquired taste for sure that I can see growing on you over time. After all, there\'92s a reason why this stall is so popular and often described as a must-visit in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#jiufen-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 We\'92ve had {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2016/10/01/yat-lok-vs-kams-two-contenders-for-hong-kongs-best-roast-goose/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul roast goose}} a few times in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2016/10/22/the-food-lovers-travel-guide-to-hong-kong/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Hong Kong}}, but this was the first time we\'92ve ever tried it steamed. I actually liked it better! Steamed goose is a specialty of the popular {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/11/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-hualien-taiwan/#mr-goose"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Mr Goose restaurant in Hualien}}.\cb1 \
\cb3 Goose is less fatty and unctuous when it\'92s steamed. It tastes cleaner, like Hainanese chicken, but it\'92s still gamey and flavorful. We tried ordering the goose thigh and leg but our server recommended we get the goose and chicken platter instead. I guess the contrast in flavor and texture between the goose and chicken makes for a more balanced experience. It\'92s served with finely julienned ginger and a soy sauce, basil, and goose fat dipping sauce to really bring out the flavor of the meat.\cb1 \
\cb3 If you dine at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/11/the-first-timers-travel-guide-to-hualien-taiwan/#mr-goose"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Mr Goose}}, then be sure to try the deep-fried fish eggs with mayonnaise as well. Pictured below at the back, it goes very well with the goose.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Grilled seafood is a common sight at Taiwanese night markets. At every night market, it seemed there was at least one stall grilling a selection of seafood like abalone, scallops, sea snails, shrimp, and oysters over a barbecue. Pictured below are some abalone and sea snails seducing me at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#fengjia-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Fengjia Night Market in Taichung}}. If you like abalone, then you\'92re going to love Taiwan. It seems to be in abundant supply and for relatively cheap too.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 23. Gua Bao (Cua Pao)\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Like \cf4 \ul lu rou fan\cf2 \ulnone  and \cf4 \ul beef noodle soup\cf2 \ulnone , the gua bao or cua pao is one of the most popular Taiwanese dishes. Often referred to as a \'93Taiwanese hamburger\'94, it\'92s basically a type of sandwich made with braised pork belly sandwiched between two halves of a Chinese steamed bun (\cf4 \ul baozi\cf2 \ulnone ). It\'92s typically dressed with pickled mustard greens, coriander, and ground peanuts.\cb1 \
\cb3 Pictured below is a gua bao we enjoyed at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#dongdamen-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Dongdamen Night Market in Hualien}}. You gotta love those thick hunks of pork belly! They\'92re so fall-apart tender they practically dissolve in your mouth. If you\'92ve never had a Chinese steamed bun before, it has a unique texture, soft and pillowy, like a cloud made of dough.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 Part of the reason why gua bao is called a Taiwanese hamburger is because of its versatility. Pork belly may be the traditional ingredient but today, it\'92s made with a variety of fillings like fried chicken, fish, eggs, and stewed beef. The ground pork gua bao pictured below was from a shop on the ground floor of our hotel in Taichung. Our room came with free breakfast so we were lucky to have this everyday during our stay. It was delicious and one of my favorite things to eat in our two weeks in Taiwan.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 24. Hot Pot\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Hot Pot is a core Taiwanese dish and something you should try on your first trip to Taiwan. Popular in East Asian countries like China and Japan, hot pot is a soup containing a variety of ingredients like thinly sliced meat, seafood, leaf vegetables, noodles, tofu, and various fish and meat balls. A simmering pot of soup stock is left on a burner at the table while diners place the raw ingredients into the pot to cook.\cb1 \
\cb3 I was wondering how hot pot differed between countries and it seems the main difference is in the dipping sauce. For Japanese hot pot or shabu-shabu, it typically contains ponzu (citrus-based sauce) and goma (sesame sauce). The dipping sauce for mainland Chinese hot pot depends on the region. In Taiwan, where hot pot is also referred to as shabu-shabu because of the Japanese influence, the dipping sauce is often made with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shacha_sauce"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul shacha sauce}} and raw egg yolk.\cb1 \
\cb3 Based on the recommendation of a Taiwanese friend, we had this fantastic hot pot at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/25/orange-shabu-shabu-house-the-best-hot-pot-in-taipei-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Orange Shabu Shabu House in Taipei}}. He called it the best hot pot in the city, and he may be right. It was phenomenal and the best hot pot we\'92ve ever tasted anywhere.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 25. Ice Cream Puff\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Some dishes you plan for, others take you completely by surprise. That was the case with these ice cream puffs from Misty Cake in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/26/10-things-to-eat-on-jiufen-old-street-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}. We didn\'92t even know they existed but once we saw tourist after tourist smashing their faces into them, we had to do it too.\cb1 \
\cb3 Misty cake has many cakes and pastries on display, but this ice creams puff is what caught our eye. The recipe is simple \'96 take two scoops of ice cream and sandwich them between two halves of a large flaky puff pastry. In ours, we chose raspberry and dark chocolate. Indulge! You\'92re on vacation.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 26. Iron Eggs\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Like \cf4 \ul ah-gei\cf2 \ulnone , iron eggs are a specialty of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tamsui}}. They\'92re chicken, pigeon, or quail eggs that have been repeatedly stewed in a tea, soy sauce, and spice mixture before being air-dried. The process shrinks the eggs, turns them a dark brown color (almost black), and makes them chewier and more concentrated in flavor.\cb1 \
\cb3 You\'92ll find them in vacuum-sealed packs like this throughout {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tamsui}}. At the store we bought them from, they were offering the eggs in spicy and non-spicy versions. I\'92m not sure if other shops have their own spin on the flavor. It\'92s a fun and tasty snack that\'92s easy to eat while walking around {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tamsui}}.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 We saw many night market stalls throughout Taiwan selling these hunks of juicy deep-fried mushrooms. They\'92re made using king trumpet mushrooms (Pleurotus eryngii) which are the largest type of oyster mushroom. Like the \cf4 \ul deep-fried squid\cf2 \ulnone , they\'92re chopped, battered, and deep-fried before being sprinkled with a seasoning of your choice.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 28. Lu Wei\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Lu wei or Taiwanese braised food is a distant cousin of \cf4 \ul hot pot\cf2 \ulnone . Commonly eaten as a snack, it involves braising a variety of ingredients in broth, then adding spices and sauces to the cooked food.\cb1 \
\cb3 You\'92ll find many roadside stalls offering lu wei at night markets. Pictured below is a lu wei stand at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#zhongxiao-road-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Zhongxiao Road Night Market in Taichung}}. With a basket in one hand and a pair of tongs in the other, customers pick what they want from a selection of braised meats, vegetables, and noodles, before handing it over to be diced up and heated in a hot soup.\cb1 \
\
\cb3 The lu wei was served in a plastic bag along with a bamboo skewer. It was a little hard to eat standing up so we went inside a convenience store so we could sit and enjoy it with cold beers.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 29. Mee Sua\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This was our last meal in Taiwan and thankfully, it was also one of the best. I\'92m not really a noodle person so I wouldn\'92t normally be excited about something like this, but the braised intestine mee sua at the ultra famous {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/03/taipei-food-guide-13-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taipei-taiwan/#ay-chung-flour-rice-noodles"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Ay-Chung Flour Rice Noodles in Ximending}} is incredibly delicious.\cb1 \
\cb3 Mee sua is a type of thin wheat-flour noodle similar to vermicelli. I read that Taiwanese mee sua typically contains oysters, but Ay-Chung makes them with the most tender bits of pork intestine. They were so soft they tasted like baby squid! The mee sua is silky smooth and the gravy had this wonderful smokey flavor. Apparently, Ay-Chung makes their soup base with bonito flakes hence the smokiness. Seriously, this was so good I couldn\'92t stop eating it. For even more flavor, you can add chili oil, garlic, and black vinegar if you like.\cb1 \
\cb3 Ay-Chung is extremely popular so expect a long line. Not to worry though, it moves quickly. This bowl of mee sua is definitely worth the wait.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?client=ca-pub-9676193958738240&output=html&h=90&w=807&bih=789&biw=1277&slotname=6050541616&adk=6914090&url=https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/07/taiwanese-food-guide-57-things-to-eat-in-taiwan-and-where-to-try-them/&frm=20&guci=1.2.0.0.2.2.0&eid=21060853,201222022,26835105,21062174&loeid=201222032&u_his=1&u_java=1&u_nplug=1&u_nmime=14&brdim=95,23,95,23,1440,23,1277,873,1277,789&prev_fmts=807x90_0ads_al&format=fpkc_al_lp&kw_type=radlink&hl=en&rt=ChBboU5oAAnj2QrgKhqjAKnFEgEgGgjX9lTGXkUEMygBUhMIseOgtaHF3QIVCbF7Ch3YOgg7eAGCAQ8KC1RhaXdhbiBUb3VyEgCCARsKF1BsYWNlIHRvIEVhdCBSZXN0YXVyYW50EgCCARAKDFRhaXBlaSBWaXNpdBIAggESCg5UYWl3YW5lc2UgRm9vZBIAiAED&ad_type=text"}}{\fldrslt

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Miyahara in Taichung is famous for its \cf4 \ul pineapple cakes\cf2 \ulnone  and Harry-Potter-like interior. But it\'92s also beloved for its ice cream, which can be bought from a little shop on the left side of the building. There you\'92ll find exotic flavors like Uganda 80% Smoked Chocolate and Sri Lankan Black Tea. If ice cream isn\'92t enough, then you can have it topped with delectable goodies like cheesecake, pineapple tarts, and almond crisps.\cb1 \
\cb3 The ice cream at Miyahara is a bit pricey, but it\'92s a fun and Instagrammable treat you can enjoy at the riverside park next to the shop. Personally, I find that ice cream in Taiwan isn\'92t as creamy as it is in other countries like the US or Japan. The dairy is less evident and it tastes like something between ice cream and sorbet.\cb1 \

It can contain sweet or salty ingredients, but the most traditional types are filled with red bean paste and rolled in peanut powder.\cb1 \

Known as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochi#Variations_outside_Japan"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul tauchi}}, it doesn\'92t have a filling and consists of plain handmade mochi covered in peanut or black sesame powder.\cb1 \

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 In Taiwan, we encountered a few dishes that blurred the line between dessert and savory snack. This peanut ice cream roll was one of them.\cb1 \
\cb3 To make it, peanut shavings are spread out over traditional popiah skin and topped with two or three scoops of ice cream. I\'92m not sure exactly what flavor of ice cream it was, but it tasted neutral and not too sweet, like vanilla. Some places may add coriander before rolling it all up like a burrito. Like \cf4 \ul boba toast\cf2 \ulnone , it\'92s an odd combination that somehow works.

It wasn\'92t loaded with as much ice cream as the one we had at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#dongdamen-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Dongdamen Night Market}}, but it was still really good. Oddly enough, I wasn\'92t all that excited to try peanut ice cream roll before our trip but it\'92s one of the dishes I remember most. It\'92s surprisingly delicious.\cb1 \

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 A pepper bun or hu jiao bing is a type of baked bun popular at Taiwanese night markets. It consists of a crunchy, flaky outer dough shell topped with sesame seeds and containing a filling of peppery marinated pork with loads of scallions. Interestingly, it\'92s cooked in a cylindrical clay oven similar to an Indian tandoori oven. Baked at high heat over charcoal, the buns are stuck to the sides of the oven and scraped off with a blunt knife or spatula when ready.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 Here\'92s a pork bun we had at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#liouhe-tourist-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Liouhe Night Market in Kaohsiung}}. The dough is delicious. It\'92s thin and crisp, almost cracker-like in texture when freshly made. As you can see, it\'92s a good-sized bun packed with lots of pork and green onions. You can find pork buns at many night markets but a great place to try it is at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#raohe-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Raohe Night Market in Taipei}}. Just look for the pepper bun stall with the longest line.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 37. Penis Waffle\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is the most scandalous dish on this list for obvious reasons. Shaped like a 7\uc0\u8243  phallus with veins, it contains a variety of fillings like red bean and peanut, sometimes even a whole sausage. It\'92s then skewered by the testicles and dipped in your choice of sauce like chocolate, strawberry, vanilla, and green bean. It\'92s a tasty snack that\'92s quite a mouthful.\cb1 \
\cb3 We had a freshly made matcha-glazed penis waffle at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#shilin-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Shilin Night Market}} when we first visited Taipei in 2014. However, recent research seems to indicate that the stand offering these penis waffles \'96 A Piece of Gayke \'96 is no longer around. We did see pre-made versions sold in boxes so keep your eye out for those if you want to try it. We saw them in Ximending and it looks like they\'92re sold in many shops at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#shilin-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Shilin Night Market}} as well.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 38. Pig\'92s Blood Cake\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Pig\'92s blood pudding on a stick is a popular street food snack that you can find at many Taiwanese night markets. It\'92s made with pork blood and sticky rice which is steamed or fried before being covered in a sweet soy sauce and coated in peanut flour and coriander.\cb1 \
\cb3 We have congealed pig or chicken blood in our native Philippines (called betamax) but this Taiwanese version is texturally different. The sticky rice makes it more firm and chewy, similar to \cf4 \ul mochi\cf2 \ulnone . It\'92s really good. We had this at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#raohe-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Raohe Night Market}} but you can find pig\'92s blood cake pretty much anywhere in Taiwan.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 39. Pineapple Cake\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 A box of pineapple cakes is one of the most popular souvenir food items you can bring back from Taiwan. As its name suggests, it\'92s a soft and sweet traditional pastry made with butter, flour, eggs, sugar, and pineapple jam.\cb1 \
\cb3 Apart from being delicious, a big reason why it\'92s so popular as a gift item is because the pineapple is considered an auspicious symbol. In Taiwanese Hokkien, the word for pineapple is 
\i ong lai
\i0 , which sounds similar to a phrase meaning \'93incoming fortune\'94.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 You\'92ll find boxes of pineapple cakes sold everywhere in Taiwan, including the airport, but one of the most famous shops is \cf4 \ul Miyahara\cf2 \ulnone . This place has become a tourist attraction in Taichung, equally popular for its library-like interior as it is for its pineapple cakes and other pastries. Isn\'92t their packaging pretty?\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 40. Pork Sausages\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 I caught these two ladies checking out my sausage in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#jiufen-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}. Sausages in different shapes and sizes are among the most common sights at Taiwanese night markets (or any market for that matter). We saw Kurobuta sausages, pearl sausages (pictured below), sausages encased in tofu skin, even sausages sandwiched in a glutinous rice \'93bun\'94. Pork is the most common but I remember seeing one stall in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/26/10-things-to-eat-on-jiufen-old-street-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}} selling sausages made with fish roe, squid, and wild boar!\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 41. Quail Eggs with Shrimp\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 I\'92m a sucker for quail eggs so I often get it whenever I see it. It makes for a tasty and easy-to-eat snack. On more than one occasion, I was seduced by night market vendors preparing these quail eggs with shrimp in grills that resembled takoyaki makers. They\'92d turn them to cook using tiny forks before adding a seasoning or sauce of your choice. Simple but delicious.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 42. Red Bean Wheel Cakes\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 A wheel cake is the Taiwanese version of Japanese {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagawayaki"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul imagawayaki}}, a pancake-like dessert made with a variety of fillings. They\'92re traditionally made with sweet azuki red bean paste, but today you\'92ll find a wide range of fillings like chocolate, vanilla custard, peanut butter, fruit, and matcha. There are plenty of savory fillings as well like corn, egg, tuna, curry, meat, and vegetable. We saw plenty of wheel cake vendors throughout Taiwan, at night markets and along sidewalks with heavy foot traffic.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 43. Scallion Pancakes\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This was one of my favorite things to eat in Taiwan. Known locally as chong zhua bing, it consists of a pan-fried piece of dough with loads of green onion layered inside. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, you can get your scallion pancake with egg or without.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 How beautiful do all those green onions look? Scallion pancake stalls are ubiquitous in Taiwan. We had this at the Shuishe Visitor Center at Sun Moon Lake. For such a simple snack, it tastes mighty good! Be sure to get it with egg as it adds richness and moisture to the pancake.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 44. Shanxi Cuisine\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This was one of the best surprises from our trip. Shanxi or Shan food is the cuisine from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanxi_cuisine"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Shanxi Province in China}}, just west of Beijing. It\'92s famous for its noodles, fried flatbreads, and sour flavors. Among the cuisine\'92s most popular ingredients are lamb and cumin, two of Ren\'92s favorite things in the world. I knew she\'92d love this place, and she did. What I didn\'92t know was how much I\'92d love it too. It turned out to be one of the best meals we had in our two weeks in Taiwan.\cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/01/shao-shao-ke-a-fantastic-shanxi-restaurant-in-taipei-taiwan/"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \cb3 \ul Shao Shao Ke in Taipei}}\cb3  is a popular restaurant known for serving good Shanxi cuisine. Pictured below is the tastiest plate of deep-fried lamb skewers made with cumin. Don\'92t let appearances fool you. I know it looks dry and tough, but it\'92s actually quite tender and juicy. It has a light crispy coating and a potent cumin flavor. We\'92ve never had lamb like this before and it bowled us over. Be sure to get the deep-fried mozzarella scones as well. They\'92re to die for.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 45. Sheng Jian Bao\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 This is one of my favorite types of \cf4 \ul baozi\cf2 \ulnone . A Shanghainese specialty that\'92s also popular in Taiwan, sheng jian bao is a pork-filled bun that\'92s fried in a shallow pan until the bottom turns brown and crunchy. Any meat-filled baozi is tasty enough, but the crunchiness from the pan-frying makes it even better.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 We enjoyed this sheng jian bao after a long day of biking on Cijin Island in Kaohsiung. As you can see, it\'92s bursting with pork and green onions. We bought this from a street vendor but I think you can find sheng jian bao pretty much anywhere in Taiwan.\cb1 \
\
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 46. Sour & Spicy Noodles\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 We saw this interesting bowl of noodles at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#liouhe-tourist-night-market"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Liouhe Night Market in Kaohsiung}}. It consisted of thick, translucent, and slippery udon-like noodles in a sour and spicy broth with plenty of scallions, peanuts, and a few slices of pork. We had no idea what it was and my Taiwanese friend couldn\'92t really explain it to me in English either. All he said was that it\'92s name in Chinese literally translates to \'93sour and spicy noodles\'94. I couldn\'92t find much information about it online but I believe it may be a Hakka dish. In any case, you may want to try it if you visit Liouhe Night Market. It\'92s a delicious bowl of noodle soup that\'92s different from others we tried in Taiwan.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 47. Steamed Taro Cake\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 These steamed taro cakes are also sold by the \cf4 \ul Ah Lan Hakka Glutinous Rice Cake\cf2 \ulnone  stall in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#jiufen-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}. It isn\'92t as popular or as interesting as the glutinous rice cake, but it\'92s also pretty good, just a little mushy from the taro filling.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 48. Stinky Tofu\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Stinky tofu is one of Taiwan\'92s most notorious dishes. It\'92s notorious because it truly does stink as much as its name suggests. I still remember the first time I tasted it in San Francisco. You could smell it from a block away, a stench that reminds me for some reason of cat poo. Ren can\'92t stand the smell at all.\cb1 \
\cb3 As foul as it smells, stinky tofu is an important part of Taiwanese food culture. Often at night markets, it attracts the longest lines because locals love the way it tastes in spite of the stench. Without question, it\'92s an acquired taste which I\'92m sadly yet to acquire.\cb1 \
\cb3 Stinky tofu is brined in a mixture of fermented milk, vegetables, and meat for as long as several months. Once the fermentation process is complete, it can be eaten cold, steamed, stewed, or deep-fried with a side of pickled mustard greens. The last is the most common preparation and the only one I\'92ve tried. You can find stinky tofu at every night market though a good place to try it in Taipei is at a restaurant called Dai\'92s House of Unique Stink. From what I\'92ve read, they\'92ve had to move shop seven times since opening because of the awful stench. Enjoy.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 49. Stuffed Chicken Wings\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 These pregnant-looking chicken wings are stuffed with fried rice. The wings are deboned and filled with fried rice before being barbecued or fried. We tried both and we preferred the barbecued version. It was smokey and more flavorful. You can find these at pretty much any night market.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 50. Sun Cake\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Known locally as taiyang bing, a sun cake is a popular Taiwanese pastry that originated in Taichung. It has a flaky crust and a maltose filling, and is usually eaten with Chinese tea. Like \cf4 \ul pineapple cakes\cf2 \ulnone , it\'92s one of the most popular souvenir food items you can bring back from Taiwan. \cf4 \ul Miyahara in Taichung\cf2 \ulnone  offers them as well.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 51. Taiwanese Breakfast\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Having a traditional Taiwanese breakfast at least once is a must-do in Taiwan. It\'92s heavy on carbs and eggs, and is usually washed down with a glass of hot soybean milk. Examples of typical Taiwanese breakfast dishes include twisted crullers (you tiao), baked wheat cake (shao bing), hot soybean milk (dou jiang), leek pie (jiu cai he zi), turnip cake (luo buo gao), and \cf4 \ul baozi (steamed buns)\cf2 \ulnone .\cb1 \
\cb3 Pictured below is the twisted cruller and bowl of hot soybean milk I had at the ultra popular {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/03/taipei-food-guide-13-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taipei-taiwan/#fuhang-soy-milk"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Fuhang Soy Milk in Taipei}}. When I say ultra popular, I really do mean ULTRA popular. The line to this Taiwanese breakfast food court snakes around the block so come as early as you can.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 I had this hearty Taiwanese breakfast good enough for two at Second Market in Taichung. The lines that form here aren\'92t as bad as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/03/taipei-food-guide-13-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taipei-taiwan/#fuhang-soy-milk"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Fuhang Soy Milk}} but it\'92s an exceedingly popular place for breakfast as well.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 52. Tanghulu\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 You\'92ll see these glossy sticks of red candied fruit everywhere. Known as tanghulu, this candied snack originated in China and involves dipping skewers of fruit in sugar syrup to form a hardened candy coating. You\'92ll find at least one stall selling tanghulu at virtually every night market in Taiwan. The most commonly used fruits seem to be strawberry and cherry tomatoes stuffed with a sliver of dried plum.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 53. Taro Balls\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Google \'93what to eat jiufen\'94 and taro balls from this shop will show up on nearly very list. Grandma Lai\'92s Taro Balls is one of the most popular eateries in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#jiufen-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Jiufen}}. You can easily find the shop from the long line of patrons waiting to enjoy their taro ball soup, which you can have either hot or cold. We chose the hot and it was swimming with chewy handmade taro balls, sweet potato balls, green tea balls, and kidney beans.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 54. Tower Ice Cream\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Like \cf4 \ul ah-gei\cf2 \ulnone  and \cf4 \ul iron eggs\cf2 \ulnone , tower ice cream is associated with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/04/16/12-night-markets-and-food-streets-to-visit-in-taiwan/#tamsui-old-street"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Tamsui}} district in New Taipei City. It\'92s basically a light saber of soft serve ice cream piled high in a cone. You can get one flavor or a combination of two. Being Asian, we got taro and mango.\cb1 \
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 55. Wu Pao Chun Bakery Bread\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Nothing makes Ren happier than freshly baked breads, so when I kept seeing this Taiwanese-French bakery pop up on must-eat lists in Taiwan, I knew we had to go. The bakery has branches in Taipei and Kaohsiung and is named after Wu Pao-chun, a Taiwanese baker renowned for his sourdough bread. He\'92s won several baking competitions in Europe and was awarded the title of Master Baker in the bread category of the 2010 Bakery Masters competition in Paris.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 There are many mouthwatering loaves of bread here to choose from, though perhaps none more famous than this Taiwan Litchi Rose Champion Bread which was the champion at the Bakery Masters in 2010. It\'92s made with mullet wine, lychee, walnuts, and rose petals. Another renowned loaf is his Taiwan Longan with Red Wine Bread which won second place at the Coupe Louise Lesaffre in 2008. It\'92s made with red wine, longan, and walnuts.\cb1 \
\cb3 We bought the litchi rose bread along with many others at their Kaohsiung branch and enjoyed it with coffee at a Starbucks next door. Everything was sensational.\cb1 \
\
\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 56. Wuyuzi (Dried Cured Mullet Roe)\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Wuyuzi is salted mullet roe. It\'92s made by salt curing the roe sac of mullet over a couple of weeks. The process dries out and intensifies the flavor of the roe while preserving it. Also known as karasumi, it\'92s similar to Korean myeongnan, Japanese mentaiko, or Mediterranean bottarga.\cb1 \
\cb3 We saw a lot of wuyuzi drying out on tables like this in Kaohsiung, but I read it\'92s a specialty of Donggang Township in west-central Pingtung County. You may want to go there if you\'92re interested in trying the best.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 We didn\'92t buy any wuyuzi but I read it\'92s softer than bottarga and consumed in a similar way. It\'92s a salty, fishy treat that you can slice or grate and mix with pasta or rice. Pictured below is a \cf4 \ul steamed bun (baozi)\cf2 \ulnone  with wuyuzi and strips of nori from \cf4 \ul Wu Pao Chun Bakery\cf2 \ulnone . Delicious!\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 57. Xiao Long Bao\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 Xiao long bao is one of the most well-known types of \cf4 \ul baozi\cf2 \ulnone , or Chinese steamed buns. It gets its name from the bamboo basket where its steamed, the xiaolong, and is traditionally filled with pork and a solid meat aspic that melts into soup when heated.\cb1 \
\cb3 The xiao long bao is originally from Shanghai, though many people feel that the best examples can be found right here in Taiwan, at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.willflyforfood.net/2018/05/03/taipei-food-guide-13-must-eat-restaurants-night-markets-in-taipei-taiwan/#din-tai-fung"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 \ul Din Tai Fung}}. Made with the thinnest of wrappers, every Din Tai Fung xiao long bao has 18 pleats apiece and weighs exactly 21 grams before steaming. Aside from the traditional pork, you can even get them mixed with crab roe and truffle. Divine.\cb1 \
\
\
\cb3 To keep from burning yourself, you\'92re meant to pierce the skin of the dumpling and slurp out the soup first before eating the whole thing. Otherwise, you may burn the inside of your mouth from the hot soup.\cb1 \

\b\fs56\fsmilli28059 \cf2 \cb3 Conclusion\cf0 \cb1 \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b0\fs30\fsmilli15200 \cf2 \cb3 57 dishes is way better than 9 but it\'92s still a ways off from painting a complete picture of Taiwanese food culture. In our two weeks there, we learned just how much Taiwanese people love to eat. This is evidenced by the many night markets you\'92ll find in every city throughout the country. We visited one new night market almost every night we were there, and had we wanted to, we probably could have visited two. That\'92s how many they have here. If you enjoy traveleating as much as we do, then you\'92re going to love Taiwan.\cb1 \
\cb3 I didn\'92t include it in this list but sushi and Japanese restaurants are a common sight in Taiwan. This was expected because of the Japanese influence. They\'92re even have many of my beloved kaiten-zushi restaurants! I considered adding sushi and unagi to this list because of their popularity in Taiwan, but I decided to keep it to dishes that have evolved to become fully or at least partially Taiwanese.\cb1 \
\cb3 In any case, I hope you enjoyed going through this guide as much as we did doing research for it. As always, it\'92s a work-in-progress that will only grow with every return visit to Taiwan.\cb1 \
\cb3 If pictures aren\'92t enough for you, then here\'92s a video of all 57 dishes included in this list. Thanks for reading and have an amazing time traveleating your way through Taiwan!\
