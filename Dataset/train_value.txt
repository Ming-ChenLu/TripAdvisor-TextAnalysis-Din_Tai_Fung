\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 The provision of \'93value\'94 to consumers by marketers is implicit in the exchange contract. Yet, value is a term fraught with so many interpretations that it is a wonder when consumers and marketers agree that such a contract exists. In fact, the many interpretations provide the impetus for the editor\'92s desire to present the reader with the chapters in this volume. As an invited author, my initial reaction to having been asked to contribute a \'93chapter\'94 was that this would be a well-defined task, one that would provide a reasonable set of boundaries for a narrative on the narrow topic of value-as-excellence. Unfortunately, value, even as excellence, was found to be subject to multiple interpretations in the literature. On the encouraging side, certain regularities were found to appear, nonetheless. This is so because value in its excellence form has taken on particular meanings in its many and varied uses. One purpose of this chapter is to take the reader through the many variants of value as used to imply degrees of excellence. A second purpose is to contrast and compare value with the two related concepts of quality and satisfaction. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In what follows, it will be presumed that the reader has been acquainted with the Holbrook (1994) framework. It can be found in many sources including the Introduction to this book and the conference proceedings on which the book is based (Holbrook 1996). Thus, the following discussion will presume that all references to \'93value\'94 in this paper refer to the self-oriented, reactive, and extrinsic cell in Holbrook\'92s typology. And specific types of value within this cell, as discussed here, are intended to be subtypes of this cell and hopefully not encroachments on the turf of other authors in this volume. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 For the reader somewhat less familiar with the fine distinctions made in the Holbrook (1994) typology, some clarification is in order concerning the present discussion on the 
\i reactive 
\i0 extrinsic self-oriented topic of value-as-excellence as opposed to the 
\i active 
\i0 version of this same combination (value-as-efficiency). In comparing the three phases of consumer behavior, namely the prepurchase period leading to choice, the act of consumption itself, and the postpurchase period, the active period is that of consumption, while the reactive periods are those of pre- and postconsumption. The reason for the passive nature of the first and last periods is that the consumer does not actively operate on the product or service in these segments. Rather, the activity of interest is evaluation, namely evaluation of product/ 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 service cues in decision-making/choice and evaluation of performance outcomes in the postpurchase time frame. Thus, the consumer is 
\i reacting 
\i0 to two kinds of information\'97memory traces and new cues in the prepurchase period and observed outcomes in the post-period. For purposes of discussion, however, this \'93hard\'94 distinction will be relaxed somewhat so that \'93reactions to action itself\'94 can be entertained as another valuation in consumption. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 As a prelude to the remainder of this chapter, it should be noted that Holbrook\'92s theory is referred to as an axiology, or the study of value and value judgments. Two writings on this topic are Hartman (1967) and Najder (1975) wherein value is defined as a relational judgment of \'93good/bad,\'94 \'93better/worse than,\'94 and \'93good/ bad for.\'94 Thus, value, at its core, is a judgment of goodness/badness and better/ worse. The task here is to define these judgments in the consumable, durable, and service markets. Upon introspection, the reader will recognize that judgments of this nature are made routinely and ubiquitously. This frequent usage, unfortunately, is problematic in the context of definition, for value has come to mean just about anything marketers and consumers wish with reference to offerings in the marketplace. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 As noted, value judgments of whatever ilk occur in two time frames. Value can be assessed or predicted prior to purchase or after. When assessed in the prepurchase period, it is referred to as desired value, preferred value (preference), or valuation. Assessments after the fact are referred to as delivered value, judged value, or evaluation. For a single consumer, the same criteria may be used in both periods or the criteria may differ, as consumption itself can be a form of discovery. At different points in this paper, the distinction may be less relevant and at others more so. Lest the reader grow weary, it would now be of \'93value\'94 to attempt to pin down those value-related terms that are more aligned with consumption outcomes.

\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Like satisfaction, value, including value-as-excellence, is a human comparator response (Oliver 1997). Individuals cannot know if some thing provided value unless a standard of valuation is available. Thus, consumption events provide value to the extent that they are judged as such. This makes value a cognitive concept for, unlike attitude or pure forms of affect (e.g., pleasure), it can exist without an affective component. That is not to say that value can not cause affect and coexist with it, but is to say that affect is not necessary for a judgment of value to come into being. Later, the issue of how consumption affect (e.g., thrill) can be judged for its value will be entertained. For now, it is convenient to say that consumers are capable of doing so. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In a comprehensive work, Zeithaml (1988) provides a perspective on value as couched in a web of consumption concepts. She finds that four themes underlie the meaning of value as derived from consumers\'92 experiences. These are: (1) low price, (2) getting what is wanted, (3) quality compared to price, and (4) what is received for what is sacrificed. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Based on further analysis, Zeithaml models value as a function of five factors. She hypothesizes that value is positively related to: (a) quality, (b) other extrinsic attributes such as functionality, (c) intrinsic attributes such as pleasure, and (d) \'93high-level abstractions\'94 including personal values. Additionally, value is posited to be a negative function of (e) perceived sacrifice, defined in terms of both monetary outlays and non-monetary costs such as time and effort. In effect, value is a positive function of what is received and a negative function of what is sacrificed. This results in a value \'93equation,\'94 as follows: 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Value = f (Receipts/Sacrifices) 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Two themes are evident from the preceding perspective. One addresses single- stimulus concepts, while the second considers two, such as the receipts/sacrifices term. Single-stimulus concepts require only one, perhaps integrated, cognition and tend to be holistic. Two- or multiple-stimuli concepts ask the consumer to consider the components in a juxtaposed or comparative manner. Each of these perspectives is elaborated next.

\i0\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Perhaps the easiest rendition of value in lay terms is the singular notion of 
\i worth. 
\i0 Price and quality, taken separately, would fit this category. Often, this is referred to as a \'93utility\'94 definition, but it is more accurate to refer to it as 
\i cardinal 
\i0 utility (see Hirshleifer 1976). While it is not my intention to slight the utility literature, the term \'93utility\'94 is frequently used as a convenient overarching concept that permits discussion of consumer goals without the necessity of greater formal specification. Moreover, although utility is frequently represented in axiomatic terms, there exists no semantic definition of utility receiving widespread acceptance. For example, writings variously describe utility as usefulness, hedonic quality, \'93pleasure,\'94 and even satisfaction (e.g., Kahneman and Varey 1991). From time to time, this fluid definition will prove to be satisfactory for the purposes addressed here, although a number of authors have recently speculated as to why utility becomes problematic when used to describe consumer outcomes in the postchoice consumption period (Huber 
\i et al. 
\i0 1997). 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Such single-stimulus definitions provide unambiguous evaluations of value and many utility investigators are relying on their use (e.g., Kemp 
\i et al. 
\i0 1995). In fact, Kemp and Willetts (1995; see also Kemp 1991) tested many measurement variations of value in the context of public goods and services. They concluded that consumers use the term pervasively, that its meaning is consistent regardless of how it is measured, and that the closest semantic term to describe value is \'93worthwhileness.\'94 Moreover, Galanter (1990) provides empirical evidence that consumers can place positive and negative value on events not normally valued in monetary terms (e.g., having twins, gum sticking to one\'92s shoe). 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Thus, value is the \'93worthiness\'94 number assigned to the concept. It permits comparisons to other valuations along a numeric continuum. Ignoring ideal points, an item\'92s value is its point estimate in currency, utility, or exchange terms. It follows that interpretations of \'93excellence\'94 are defined by valuations on the high side of the continuum; items lacking excellence are positioned at the low end. For the purpose of its use, it does not matter that the concept of value can be defined in a greater dimensionality; utility estimates take these additional dimensions into account by virtue of utility\'92s holistic nature. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Many common events benefit from the singular notion of utility-as-worth, which is frequently defined in currency terms. For example, in its many variants, worth can mean the exchange terms required for acquisition (e.g., cost), the exchange value obtained at disposition (e.g., sale price), the estimated or imagined value of the item in ownership (e.g., appraisal), what one would be willing to pay if ownership were possible (e.g., the bid), and what one would require to give up the item (e.g., the asked). For the same item at the same time, each of these could vary, sometimes measurably. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Worth has taken on specific evaluative forms in different areas. Interestingly, the discipline which has advanced this concept more than others is securities analysis. It is now generally recognized that the worth of a firm is its value to shareholders and firm valuation is now 
\i de rigeur 
\i0 in financial circles. In this area, empirical valuation models are now well developed and value estimates are now routinely made. This has prompted one set of authors to begin their book with the exploratory query \'93Why value value?\'94 (Copeland 
\i et al. 
\i0 1996). This question immediately sets the stage for further analysis as it implies that value can be elusive and requires valuation attempts beyond the simple act of pricing. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 One main implication from the financial markets that seems to have eluded many marketers is that price and value are not necessarily congruent. Consumers buy and rebuy toothpaste for a price, but have no easy means of estimating the value to their dental health provided by regular usage of this substance. In actuality, the value of a dentifrice may be manyfold its cumulative cost. Thus, as in securities investing, the value in this context is the (discounted) cumulative future return of the item. Other examples include education, wellness programs, and insurance. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Perhaps the most common example of a single-stimulus value judgment is in the realm of hedonic consumption (Hirschman and Holbrook 1982). Here, the concepts of value, utility and pleasure merge, as the foremost as well as some current interpretations of utility are that of pleasure. In the earliest writings on utility, Bentham ([1823] 1968) referred to utility as the hedonic quality of experience\'97attaining pleasure and avoiding pain. And in recent writings, Kahneman and Snell (1990) and Kahneman and Varey (1991) reintroduce pleasure, sometimes described as satisfaction, as an equivalent descriptor of the value of experience. (The intervening years were dominated by decision utility or revealed preference\'97see Schoemaker 1982.) 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The valuation of pleasure and its negative counterpart pain, both experienced affects, would at first appear to be a single stimulus judgment. Individuals are known to exclaim that they are happy or sad, pleased or displeased, or mirthful or 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 sorrowful as if it were a single judgment. The qualifier \'93very\'94 on any of these terms simply moves the judgment to one or the other extreme of a single continuum. Indeed, many one-item scales or rank scores of both extremes of the hedonic continuum exist and have been used for some time (e.g., Rokeach 1973; Andrews and Withey 1976; Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers 1976). Thus, it would seem that hedonic consumption could be easily valued by virtue of the \'93pleasure\'94 it provides. It does not matter that variants of pleasure, such as thrill, are attained in such consumption, for thrill can be viewed as a high energy form of pleasure. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 This writer sees pleasure as value or value as pleasure as an oversimplification. Taking the experience of hedonic pleasure as an ultimate outcome of life ignores the literature on subjective well-being which clearly shows that even pleasure is relative (e.g., Parducci 1968; Campbell 
\i et al. 
\i0 1976; Crosby 1976). Individuals have both internal and external mechanisms by which to compare their current level of \'93pleasure.\'94 An obvious example is pain, a negative sensation that clearly is compared to the human resting state of homeostasis (Solomon and Corbit 1974). Individuals know that pain is unpleasant because their bodies have evolved to sense and display it. A medical pain scale uses this comparative notion to assess the severity of pain where the greatest extreme point is phrased as \'93as much as you can bear.\'94 This immediately begs the issue of degrees of pain at bearable and unbearable levels. Similarly, pleasure can be compared to its prior internally experienced levels. Thrill, ecstasy, and delight can all be compared to simple pleasure or happiness. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Use of external comparative referents to determine one\'92s pleasure value is also common. Most have heard of the previously satisfied consumer who becomes dis- gruntled when it is found that others acquired a similar item for less cost or found greater value. Marketers use this innate human comparative tendency to create dissatisfaction with older models of the same brand (e.g., auto-design changes) or competitive offerings. And, on the positive side of the situation, seemingly unhappy individuals can change their state of mind by shifting the comparative referent to a lower standard as in the \'93satisfied poor\'94 (Olson and Schober 1993). 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Moreover, theories of worthy or ultimate life values (e.g., Scott 1965; Maslow 1970) do not list the sensation of pleasure; rather these lists are overrepresented with virtuous traits (e.g., kindness, honesty) or enduring life situations (e.g., self- esteem, self-fulfillment). Pleasure is simply too fleeting a sensation to be held out as an ultimate life experience. Further, the satisfaction literature (to be discussed), sees pleasure as one component along with other affects and cognitions. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Nonetheless, hedonic consumption is pursued by consumers and one must assume that the resulting affects and more distinct emotions provide a sense of \'93value\'94 to these individuals. Unfortunately, a generally agreed-upon metric for measuring or comparing hedonic utility to other types of \'93value\'94 has not been forthcoming. Generally, researchers assume that, when given a list of mixed goods, services, and aesthetics, consumers can \'93value\'94 them on a common scale. For example, Kemp 
\i et al. 
\i0 (1995) measured the value to consumers of varied items from cash to chocolate to bus trips to wine on an 11-point 0\'9610 scale bounded by \'93you think this item is completely useless or valueless to you\'94 to \'93very great personal

\fs26\fsmilli13333 use or value.\'94 Note that this is a very different question from the affect scales used for measuring pleasure or other positive affects (e.g., Watson 
\i et al. 
\i0 1988) and still more different from scales recommended for satisfaction (Oliver 1997). Thus, hedonic value is measured empirically but the researcher takes much on faith in assuming that the as yet unknown psychophysics of valuating pleasure will manifest themselves in consumer ratings. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Another now-popular version of value has arisen in current discussions of a loyal customer base. One road to loyalty, it is said, is to provide value to customers\'97 thus value-based loyalty (e.g., Fredericks and Salter 1995). But this implies that the value behind the loyalty to one firm be greater than that of another, itself implying a comparison. Note, that this rendition of value demands that the specific nature of the comparator be made, for it immediately begs the question of \'93value compared to what?\'94 Writers are quite clear on what this comparison is\'97value compared to that of competitive offerings. So, what is it that is supposed to be compared? It is presumed that the consumer should know \'97or the marketer will inform him/her. The present discussion is now in the realm of dual-stimulus definitions, to be pursued shortly. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Before doing so, however, it is instructive to evaluate single-stimulus definitions in the context of the purpose of this chapter, to explore value-as- excellence. Can the expression of worth or utility or even pleasure connote excellence? As noted, high levels of these variables imply greater value, but is this high level of value excellence? A current teen expression of endearing performance is \'93Excellent, Dude.\'94 Does this phrase capture the essence of excellent value? No, excessively positive or exuberant phrases simply mean that a high level of the delivered outcome was experienced. If the outcome were truly known to be the very highest possible\'97the superlative outcome, excellence would be implied. To say this, a standard of comparison is needed and a dual-stimulus perspective is required.

\i0\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Value in the context of two stimuli is by definition a comparative process. This is not the same as saying that value is defined by two dimensions, such as the ambience and food served in a restaurant. Rather, the two stimuli do not have to be on the same conceptual plane as in the proverbial choice between what one has and the unknown behind a closed door. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 There are two comparative processes consumers can take in assessing value. The first is an intra-product comparison such as when benefits are compared to costs; the second is an inter-product comparison that occurs when consumers compare the value of a product to its alternatives. The first comparison is actually a precursor to the second, but consumers do not necessarily process value comparisons in two stages. Both views are prominent in the literature, however. Most academics research the first comparison for an understanding of the underlying psychological process of value determination, while practitioners talk about the 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 second comparison for its relation to loyalty, a inter-offering judgment. Thus, one can judge the value of a monopolistic offering, or consumers can simply state that they find more value in a product than in its competition and, because of this, will continue to rebuy it in the future. Discussion of each follows.

\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 There is a growing body of literature on the meaning of consumption value from the perspective of the consumer, as compiled by Woodruff (1997) and Woodruff and Gardial (1996). In the latter source, the authors propose a summary definition whereby value is defined as the customer\'92s desire for specific consequences instrumental in accomplishing an intended goal. Here, it is clear that value is a derivative of the consumer\'92s goals in purchasing. Woodruff and Gardial elaborate on this definition by distinguishing between 
\i value in use 
\i0 and 
\i value in possession. 
\i0 Use value implies that the goal of purchasing is for the functional consequences of the product or service. The product is simply a means to an end such as when a disposable battery is used to power a toy. Possession value, in contrast, implies that the mere ownership of a product is its goal. Art, status symbols, and accomplishments such as mountain climbing qualify here. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In the first case, the value to the customer is what he/she would pay for the functional consequences and not the product itself. Thus, the same long-life battery used for a pacemaker would have greater value than when used for a watch. The fact that the battery may cost the same for both uses again illustrates the divergence of value and price. In the second case, the value is purely psychological and may differ greatly across consumers. Clearly, the owner of a unique Van Gogh places a higher value on possession of this piece than any other and may not part with it \'93for any price.\'94 Only when the owner desires to sell at auction, perhaps, does some correspondence between value and price materialize. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 These examples illustrate the intra-product comparison process. Here the valuation is against a goal of consumption. In the case of value in use, the goal is the production of desired consequences. In the battery example, the battery\'92s value is powering a toy. The value of the toy, in turn, is in providing enjoyment. Interestingly, the toy is typically valued more highly than the battery despite the fact that the toy would not be functional without the battery. One could say that the toy absent the battery still retains value in possession, as if to say that one\'92s toy contains enjoyment potential despite the fact that it is not powered. For example, one could put the toy on a shelf and admire it, whereas the same sort of appreciation would be unlikely in the case of a battery. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The conundrum here is that the toy\'92s utility can also be judged against the activity which might be pursued in its stead, including the resting state. Thus, the enjoyment of playing with the toy can be compared to the imagined enjoyment of playing with another toy, watching TV, or doing nothing at all. In this framing, the battery and the toy should have the same value, since the enjoyment of play cannot take place without both. But again, they do not. 
\fs24 \

\i\fs26\fsmilli13333 Value as excellence 
\i0 49 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 50 
\i Richard L.Oliver 
\i0\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 This example, one of value in use, misses the essence of value as excellence. One cannot judge excellence without reference to directly comparable alternatives. Only by abstracting to more general categories can an excellence judgment be made. For example, one can exclaim that they have had an excellent dining experience or that playing with the aforementioned toy is excellent entertainment, but the consumer has done nothing more than broaden the category of dining and entertainment to include many diverse forms of these pastimes. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Value in possession may or may not have an excellence component to it. If one owns the finest example of a particular antiquity, its possession has excellence, uniqueness, and pride of ownership. One can own lesser forms of this same object (e.g., less excellence), but still retain uniqueness and pride of ownership. In fact, the rarest forms of an antiquity are often graded on their excellence (e.g., a rare coin). In still another example, one can have pride of ownership (i.e., possession), of a non-excellent and non-unique object. Children often covet their playthings even though they are very common. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 This brings the discussion to comparisons of what is received to what is given, as in the definition of value a function of rewards versus costs. Numerous examples of this type of value assessment are available. 
\i Consumer Reports 
\i0 frequently rates products as \'93best buys.\'94 This means that, in their estimation, the ratio of what is received to its price is the best \'93value for the money.\'94 The publication typically finds that many medium and even low priced products are \'93best buys.\'94 In the same way, computers are rated on the basis of computing speed per dollar, common household and grocery items are rated on volume of contents per dollar, and homes on the basis of dollars per square foot of living space. As long as the something per dollar is quantifiable or nearly so, this comparison is too tempting to ignore. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Thus, one can produce a hierarchical list of the degree to which cost is embedded in the internal valuation process. At the uppermost level, cost is irrelevant. The value of the outcome (i.e., its goal) is sought at any cost. An infertile couple\'92s desire to have children is an example of this, as is a terminally ill patient\'92s willingness to spend and risk all to recover, as is an addict\'92s craving for the drug of choice. Bidders at auctions will often engage in \'93bidding wars\'94 over a desired object and collectors often will pay \'93any price\'94 to complete a collection (or to start one). In a phrase, this type of value is \'93priceless\'94\'97priceless value. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Skipping to the extreme, lower level of internal value, the consequences and, perhaps, goal-related outcomes are compared to price or cost more generally. Now cost is considered in the value equation and value can be both internal and external. This is to say that the item can be assessed in isolation from any other thing as long as a value rule is known. For example, a coin can be valued for its gold content using the current price of gold as a standard. It can also be given additional valuation based on its rarity, where rarity is based on the original number of coins minted, those remaining in circulation, etc. And it can further be valued on its condition, with the degree of wear determined by the level of detail which remains. Interestingly, this same single-object valuation now permits two objects, similarly judged, to be compared. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Elaboration on the middle level of cost consideration in value, reserved until now, necessarily takes the discussion to inter-object comparisons. Thus, it provides a segue to the more formal material in the next section, presented shortly. At this middle level, cost is considered only in relation to a general category of similar pursuits. One way to look at this is to assume a fixed cost for an item or activity and examine all alternatives that fulfill this criterion. A common example is travel or vacationing. Consumers will have saved many thousands of dollars earmarked for a vacation. The travel agent is instructed to prepare alternatives that fall within this cost constraint. The cost is then considered forgone, and is not entertained further. The alternatives, however, are still considered for their value. Generally, these will be qualitatively different alternatives and compete on that basis. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Still other examples are home buying, entertainment, education, and aesthetics. In the case of home buying, the upper limit as to cost is set by the buyer\'92s income. This puts a cap on the range of homes under consideration. As all buyers are encouraged by brokers and financial planners to \'93buy as much house as you can\'94 because the mortgage payments are fixed, whereas income usually rises, the homes under consideration are in the same price range, but differ markedly in terms of architectural design, layout, location, etc. Thus, for each residence under consideration, the constellation of home facets is judged for its (intrinsic) value. This value, then, becomes the criterion on which the houses are judged against one another\'97an inter-object comparison as discussed next.

\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Here the excellence judgment is now more direct. As alluded to in the preceding discussion, a direct comparative referent is needed to form the prototype against which alternatives are compared. This may be an ideal object or, absent that, \'93best in class.\'94 Inter-object comparisons permit an additional dimension not available to intra-object evaluations. Whereas intra-object valuations require some internal or external standard of measure, inter-object comparisons do not. As long as consumers can indicate a preference between two of these, the evaluation standards do not require specification. Oftentimes, individuals cannot state why they prefer one alternative to another (Wolfe 1998). This is particularly true in matters of aesthetics, foodstuffs, \'93taste,\'94 and even romance. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The desire on the part of researchers to understand the \'93hidden\'94 criteria consumers use has prompted research on \'93preference,\'94 such as preference mapping and study of the inner workings of the brain. Whereas science may eventually discover how individuals make preference judgments when they lack the cognitive ability to do so, this does not concern the present discussion. The preferences exist, nonetheless, and the preferred item is the one consumers value most. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Writers have searched for the best way to describe the hidden evaluation function discussed previously. While many options are available including scaling, conjoint analysis, and multi-attribute attitude modeling, it would be convenient if a single concept could be studied for insight on how the consumer views the focus of this chapter, that of value-as-excellence. In both lay and business terms, this concept is

\fs26\fsmilli13333 typically referred to as \'93quality.\'94 How is quality as \'93excellence\'94 related to value? As Holbrook (1994) notes, it is a component of value in broader terms. His framework presumes that the value of consumption increases as quality increases. What, then, is quality?

\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Oliver (1996, 1997) provides a summary of quality definitions based on the extant literature (e.g., Garvin 1984; Steenkamp 1990). He categorizes the terms used in various writings on the topic into three conceptual perspectives. The first, 
\i attainment, 
\i0 implies that an object has achieved a high level of technical accomplishment. Phrases describing this perspective include \'93innate excellence,\'94 \'93superiority,\'94 and \'93uncompromising standards.\'94 Thus, marketers wishing to bestow impressions of \'93quality\'94 can suggest to consumers that their consumable is paramount on some high level standard of unspecified dimensions. Readers will recognize this as similar to the previous discussion of utility and, as will be noted, similar problems are evident. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The second perspective, 
\i desirability, 
\i0 refers to the consumer\'92s need for attachment to the consumable. Phrases such as those used in earlier sections of this paper appear here, such as \'93preference\'94 and \'93worth.\'94 Interestingly, Oliver (1997) includes \'93affordable excellence\'94 here as if to differentiate it from \'93innate\'94 excellence, reflecting the ability on the part of the consumer to actually own what s/he desires. Generally, this perspective relates to the attractiveness of the consumable and suggests a level of quality that can be possessed. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The third perspective, 
\i usefulness, 
\i0 reflects the influence of utility-based reasoning on quality definitions. Phrases such as \'93fitness for use\'94 and \'93capacity to fulfill wants\'94 characterize this perspective. Thus, quality can be defined in terms of the consequences of consuming as well as its attractiveness or \'93excellence.\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Of interest is the fact that value is more akin to the desirability perspective. Like quality, value can be assessed before and after usage. One does not have to experience quality to estimate or assess it. At this point, however, the answer to the question of the role of quality in value has not been given. Part of the reason is that, like value, quality can be discussed as a single stimulus concept without a comparative referent. For example, in the three perspectives of quality, one might ask: \'93What is it that has been attained?,\'94 \'93What, exactly, does the product possess to make it so desirable?,\'94 and \'93For what purpose is the consumable useful?\'94 Like value, these questions require consideration of the comparative referent\'97the second of the dual stimulus definitions, to be exact.

\i0\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Some of the phrases given to illustrate the three perspectives do hint at a comparison referent. For example, \'93affordable excellence\'94 implies that this virtue is achieved at a reasonable cost and, hence, represents value. Similarly, the word \'93superiority\'94 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 implies that some other alternative must be inferior. And fulfilling wants assumes that the level of want is understood. To address these unspecified standards, writers have relied on two criteria. Both would be recognized by most as incontrovertible standards for quality assessment. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The first of these, 
\i ideals, 
\i0 derives from early interest of the part of consumer researchers in ideal point models (Green and Wind 1973). Generally it is assumed that the ideal consumable can be elicited by the consumer through the calculation of distances from current market offerings to an imagined ideal brand. Thus, quality can be defined in terms of a difference from the ideal with small distances being preferred. In the absence of an ideal or in the inability of consumers to imagine what an ideal brand would entail, consumers can be asked to compare offerings to a \'93best brand\'94 (Cadotte 
\i et al. 
\i0 1987). 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The second of the quality comparators is 
\i excellence. 
\i0 Excellence is a criterion many companies and quality promoters frequently use in describing their consumables. It would appear to be one notch below an ideal product as it only requires that the consumable be rated among the top in its field. As long as consumers can imagine an excellent product, whether it exists or not, excellence or phrases similar to it can be held out as a standard. In fact, in their proposed measure of service quality, Parasuraman 
\i et al. 
\i0 (1991) ask respondents to assess performance against standards of 
\i excellent 
\i0 companies. Here, excellent companies could be either real (\'93best brand\'94) or imagined (a better best brand). The ideal referent, by comparison, is one step removed in a potentially unattainable direction. And in a variant of this standard, a local seller of plants advertises itself as the \'93superlative florist.\'94 Not ideal, but superlative. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 As noted, both variants of quality rely on a comparison referent to infer value. The value addressed here, however, does not take sacrifices into account. Like the grading of a diamond by the four \'93Cs\'94 standards\'97cut, color, clarity, carat weight \'97quality, generally, is an externally mediated perception that a product or service possesses excellent levels of the key quality dimensions which define quality for that product/service. Thus, perceived levels of quality are cognitive in nature and, as such, can remain in the consumer\'92s mind for extended periods as well as be reinforced by external cues including advertising and word-of-mouth. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Thus, quality is representative of the first examples of the value hierarchy, priceless value, where cost is not explicitly considered. In fact, market forces will determine what monetary valuation is placed on various quality grades in the manner of diamond pricing. The excellence criteria, the four Cs, are invariant and standard tables have been prepared for grading. Other factors such as inflation, availability, brand (e.g., Tiffany), and the trend in marriages will help influence the cost to the consumer. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 This notwithstanding, quality 
\i is 
\i0 one of the components of value in consumption. Consumers derive value from quality; it enhances their consumption experience and, in economic terms, gives them added utility. Thus, quality is a precursor to both value and satisfaction (Oliver 1997). This brings up the issue of how value relates to satisfaction. Just what is satisfaction and how does it relate to value?

\i0\b \cf2 Value as a satisfaction-like postpurchase comparison? 
\b0\fs24 \cf2 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 As noted, Holbrook (1994; Holbrook and Corfman 1985) posits that there are eight fundamental types of value in consumption. The dimensions on which they are based define the consumer\'92s essential criteria for forming value judgments. In order, the dimensions include: (a) whether the outcomes are judged with reference to the self or others, (b) whether the outcomes are actively accomplished (\'93done by\'94 the consumer) or are reactively appreciated (\'93done to\'94 the consumer), and (c) whether the outcomes are valued for their relation to another goal (extrinsic) or are valued as an end in themselves (intrinsic). This allows for the emergence of the following values: efficiency, excellence, status, esteem, play, aesthetics, ethics, and spirituality.\
Elsewhere, Oliver (1996) notes that satisfaction, another frequently pursued goal of consumption, does not appear in the Holbrook typology. He raises a number of interesting questions. Namely: (1) Is satisfaction value\'97are they the same concept? (2) Is satisfaction one of the values in the Holbrook typology? (3) Is it an additional value defined by another dimension not considered (e.g., extended value)? Is satisfaction a related, but conceptually distinct, concept? (4) If so, is satisfaction an antecedent of value\'97do consumers receive value from satisfaction? (5) Alternatively, is it a consequent\'97do consumers receive satisfaction from value in consumption? And (6) Are satisfaction and value linked bidirectionally in a larger web of consumption constructs? See a graphical depiction of each of these alternative representations in Figure 2.1. 
\fs24 \

\i\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 What, now, is value? 
\i0\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 These questions are intriguing but cannot be pursued until there is some agreement over the definitions of satisfaction and value. By now the many approaches taken here to pin down a value definition point to three possibilities, corresponding to the three representations of value as to whether or not it relates to sacrifice. The first is what the consumable gives the consumer regardless of cost. It is utility in its truest sense. It is how much the consumer would suffer\'97 how much less the consumer would be\'97in its absence. This includes items that can be assessed for their worth and those that cannot\'97the priceless item. When an individual claims that his or her life would be \'93worthless\'94 without some entity, that person\'92s very existence is the value of that entity to him/her. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The second definition is a comparative assessment to other alternatives whether qualitatively similar or not. Here the phrase \'93more value than\'94 (although the actual valuation may not have been made) comes into play. This is an ordinal assessment that may be quantifiable. When individuals drop out of the workforce to pursue an MBA, they are making an implicit judgment that their future job prospects will have more value at the end of the program than if they had stayed in the labor market and worked for the length of the MBA program. Unfortunately, the true value of this comparison can never be known, but it is projected nonetheless. Oftentimes, the cost of the interlude is substantial, involving both tuition and forgone income. The individual makes the value determination regardless. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 The third definition reflects the value \'93equation\'94 of outcomes compared to sacrifices and is characterized by the \'93best buy\'94 moniker. Here the comparison is explicit in the definition. Which of these \'93values\'94 is the real value? One way of answering this question is to look for commonalities among them. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 What is apparent is that the numerator of the value equation is common to all. What the consumer has, will have, or believes they have or will have is the universal. Thus, like the notion of utility, value is the additional \'93worth\'94 an entity brings to one\'92s life. Absent the object, the consumer suffers a value decrement. Separately, it is the consumer\'92s choice whether comparisons are made to internal or external standards, other alternatives, or to cost. If any of these comparisons are made, the

\i0\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 value takes on other nuances, but still is value. Thus, value is what is added to the consumer\'92s existence. This addition can be cast in terms of additional pleasure, monetary worth, or simple \'93utility.\'94 Or it can be cast in terms of maintaining pleasure or ensuring against loss of pleasure (e.g., insurance). Or it can be cast in terms of restoring an individual to homeostasis as in the case of a medicine restoring health. Of interest is the fact that these three perspectives on value correspond to what Oliver (1989, 1997) has called \'93satisfaction-as-pleasure,\'94 \'93satisfaction-as- contentment,\'94 and \'93satisfaction-as-relief.\'94 Thus, there must be some correspondence between value and satisfaction, as follows. 
\fs24 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\i\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 What, now, is satisfaction and what is its role in value? 
\i0\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 In Oliver (1997), satisfaction is defined as 
\i pleasurable fulfillment. 
\i0 That is, the consumer senses that consumption fulfills some need, desire, goal, etc. and that this fulfillment is pleasurable. The primary emphasis here is on pleasure, because some fulfillment is unpleasant (paying taxes, doing laundry). Even overfulfillment can be unpleasant (overeating, too much of a good thing generally), while some underfulfillment can provide pleasure (palliatives, emergency repairs). Thus, satisfaction is the consumer\'92s sense that consumption has provided pleasant outcomes against a standard of pleasure/displeasure. It is a singular response to a consumption event. This notion of outcomes compared to a standard suggests that the cost-based perspective on value may play a role in the value-satisfaction conundrum, as follows. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Few would disagree that a comparison of performance outcomes (i.e., quality) to sacrifices (i.e., cost-based value) is, in all likelihood, one of the antecedents of satisfaction. That would make it one of the comparative operations in satisfaction formation which can be added to those discussed in Oliver (1997). See Table 2.1. In this perspective, the \'93receipts compared to sacrifices\'94 version of value is viewed as one among the other comparative operations in postpurchase judgments. In effect, it operates in parallel with the other comparators in the satisfaction response. This view is consistent with Zeithaml\'92s (1988) position that a cost-based definition of value is an antecedent of satisfaction. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In a seemingly tautological perspective, it may also be the case that satisfaction is a precursor to value. That is, some of the value derived from consumption could be satisfaction-based. This begs the question of where satisfaction belongs in the Holbrook typology. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Oliver (1996) notes that, for satisfaction to be an input to the value one receives in consumption, it must provide one of the outcomes in the Holbrook typology or provide an outcome not accounted for in his paradigm. Close inspection of the Holbrook (1994) cells, which include efficiency, excellence, status, esteem, play, aesthetics, ethics, and spirituality, suggests that these outcomes, if attained, would provide a sense of satisfaction to the recipient. If satisfaction is still another component of value, then what is the missing dimension on which it is defined? One conclusion from this analysis is that satisfaction and value are related but different concepts and that satisfaction is not a variant of value. More will be said of this next.

\b\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 What 
\i is 
\i0 the relation between satisfaction and value? 
\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 It is now time to answer the question of which of the frameworks in Figure 2.1 are most accurate, given the logic and analysis presented here. It should be noted at the outset that the first representation, number (1) in Figure 2.1, can be dismissed. Satisfaction emerges as a distinct construct when compared to 
\i any 
\i0 of the definitions of value discussed here. To show this, it is only necessary to provide example cases where satisfaction can exist in the absence of value and where value can exist in the absence of satisfaction, an exercise useful in distinguishing satisfaction from quality (see Oliver 1993). In what follows, two examples are given, one relating to the first perspective of value as having no bearing on cost, and a second where receipts are compared to costs. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In an example of priceless value, a consumer may own an heirloom, passed down from forebears that is of immense value on the market. Yet this hypothetical consumer exclaims that she has no need for it, stores it in a safe, and derives no satisfaction from it. It is not fulfilling in any way and is a mere possession. Alternatively, a simple possession such as a common jigsaw puzzle may be very satisfying each time it is completed, but has no value beyond its ability to challenge and satisfy. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In another example involving sacrifices, the actual cost may have been sufficiently low and even zero as in a free good. In this case, just about any level of reasonable receipts may provide immense value. The consumer, however, may find little satisfaction or even need fulfillment in this case. An unneeded or disliked gift of great value would provide yet another example. Alternatively, a needed item may come very dear (expensive), giving great satisfaction but little value in the receipts over cost sense. For example, a makeshift emergency automobile repair may be truly satisfying (i.e., satisfaction-as-relief; see Oliver 1989) if it enables a motorist to reach the nearest service station. The road mechanic may charge an exorbitant price, thereby offering poor value for this \'93service.\'94 The motorist\'92s

\i0 57 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 58 
\i Richard L.Oliver 
\i0\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 needs, however, were fulfilled nonetheless. Here, the \'93value\'94 is of a higher order and must be explained without regard for cost. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 These examples illustrate both the divergence and interplay between satisfaction and value. As noted previously, satisfaction is the consumer\'92s fulfillment response. The value of this response is the end-state of the consumer after having been satisfied (fulfilled). Satisfaction provides value in what it leaves with the consumer\'97the satisfied state. It may also be the case that knowing that one has received value can be satisfying, as in the cost-based version; alternatively satisfaction may provide a sense of 
\i extended 
\i0 value in that the consumer values (places a high utility on) being satisfied. This may explain the basis for the conundrum of the primacy of satisfaction or value. At the same time that consumption value enhances satisfaction, satisfaction may be a valued outcome for many consumers. The extent to which satisfaction provides extended \'93value\'94 awaits further research. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 This brings the discussion back to Figure 2.1 and the question of which of the six representations is correct. Having previously dismissed representation (1), the preceding analysis would suggest that representation (2) is also problematic. The reason is clear from the difficulty noted earlier of positioning satisfaction in the Holbrook (1994) typology. Unless satisfaction is a 
\i personal 
\i0 value, a combination of topics that has not been extensively studied as yet, satisfaction cannot be considered to be contained in a set of values despite the fact that it may be valued. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Representation (3) goes beyond that of (2) to suggest that there is a conceptually higher plane of \'93extended value,\'94 alluded to previously. This would take discussion to a higher order of value in consumer consumption, approaching the issue of the quality of life. In essence, attaining and receiving elements of value as well as being satisfied would jointly contribute to the (extended) value of one\'92s life. This too, is an under-researched issue in consumption and life quality, in general. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 In contrast to the first of the six representations, there is merit to the remaining three perspectives in Figure 2.1. When value is viewed as a desirable end-state of consumption (Woodruff and Gardial 1996), satisfying consumption events are of value to consumers. Thus, being satisfied gives value. Again, the state of satisfaction is separate from the end-state of being satisfied, which is valued. Thus, there is merit to representation (4). Similarly, when value is viewed as receipts compared to costs, it becomes one of the satisfaction comparators of Table 2.1. In this case, value gives satisfaction as in representation (5). 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 It is now apparent that representation (6) may be the most accurate of those entertained here. Value and satisfaction mutually influence each other as value transforms and modulates between calculated states and end states. Both have common antecedents in consumption events, such as product or service performance, and both have common consequences such as loyalty. Thus, both are embedded in a web of consumption constructs, as suggested earlier. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 This latter perspective also suggests the role of quality in value. In agreement with Zeithaml (1988), quality is an input to value. Value, then, becomes a super- ordinate concept subsuming quality. And, in accord with Oliver (1993, 1997), quality is an input to satisfaction through the comparison of performance to excellence standards. Then, in a seemingly circular pattern, quality enhances satisfaction and value, which provides additional satisfaction\'97satisfaction deriving first from quality and then from value. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 It should not be overlooked that the value and satisfaction provided by quality derive from other desired purchase outcomes which, by their nature, define the essence of quality. As typically found in studies investigating the meaning of quality to consumers (e.g., Gutman and Alden 1985), quality brings reliability, durability, status, self-confidence, and ease of decision-making. For these reasons, quality is value, thereby being a \'93valued quality\'94 in consumption. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 These relationships have been portrayed graphically in Figure 2.2. There, one can see the \'93web of consumption constructs\'94 in which quality, cost-based value, satisfaction, and higher forms of consumption value are embedded. Thus, value- as-excellence is not \'93one thing.\'94 Rather it is a constellation of consumption-related constructs which includes quality, an excellence-based consumer judgment. One hopes that researchers will use this framework to corroborate the reasoning presented here.

\i0\b0\fs24 \cf2 \
\pard\pardeftab720\sl300\sa240\partightenfactor0

\fs26\fsmilli13333 \cf2 Because the issue of personal value has been broached earlier in this paper, the discussion would be remiss if some attempt were not made to address it. Before proceeding, however, a distinction between consumption value and personal value requires elaboration. Specifically, it is suggested that the value derived from consumption does not necessarily correspond to values desired by individuals in general which reflect desirable end states in life sought by all individuals (see Corfman 
\i et al
\i0 . 1991). For example, the Kahle (1984) List of Values includes accomplishment, belongingness, enjoyment, excitement, fulfillment, fun, security, self-respect, and warm relationships. Note that some of these, such as enjoyment 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 60 
\i Richard L.Oliver 
\i0\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 and security can be obtained through consumption while others, such as self- fulfillment, are not easily achieved in this manner. While means-end chain analysis provides a way of linking consumption to values (e.g., Gutman 1991), it does so only indirectly and without explicit consideration of satisfaction\'92s role in the process. 
\fs24 \

\fs26\fsmilli13333 Researchers are encouraged to forge ahead with a renewal of research connecting consumption events (including the attainment of value) to the contribution they make to the enhancement of personal value. More has been written on the intuition inherent in this statement than on its substance. Means- end chain analysis does efficiently show how consequences of consumption affect values directly. What it does not yet do is connect higher order consumption value to personal values. Some would say that these higher order utilities and values have been included in the various lists of values that have been proposed. This remains an empirical question, one worthy of future attention.
