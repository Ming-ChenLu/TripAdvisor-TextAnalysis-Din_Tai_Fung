Locals very friendly and these classic dumplings a winner again.\,,,,,,,2018/7/20, Very busy but very efficient. Outside whilst waiting you can fill in you order. Helpful is the English translation and the pictures. Never had dim sum like this before. Very clean. Friendly staff. Speak English very well. Polite. Don't miss this when you are in Taipei\,,,,,,,2018/7/20, We really enjoyed this please! The service is great and the food is really something! If you don't dare to eat at the local venues you should rather try this please. \,,,,,,,2018/7/19, Just want to see what it all about. The food was great and tasty.Am I a fan of it? Not really. It was a bit pricey for what it worth.But I had a good times with friends.\,,,,,,,2018/7/18, It\'a1\'a6s usually full but around 3pm on weekdays you will bet better service and get inside without a reservation.The food as any tingtaifung is delicious but being so famous tends to make it hard to get inside without waiting a long time or making reservations in advance.It can be more expensive than other restaurants in Taipei but I think it\'a1\'a6s worth to go at least once and try their xiaolongbao.\,,,,,,,2018/7/18,  Beautiful dumplings and other dishes.

We were not familiar with the ordering system but with number codes and pictures got the job done with the help of the 1 or 2 staff with some English. Some of our group wanted to order the white wine but the staff explained it was not going to be what they expected so we stuck to beer and green tea. Food was great and good quantity.

I have eaten at Din Tai Fung outside of Taiwan (Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney and Bangkok). Whilst they are all good, Taipei definitely is the best, and consistently good too.

Special mention to Albee for her thoughtfulness in placing a chair cover over my scarf to protect it. We ordered the house special entree, mushroom dumplings, fried rice with egg water spinach, chocolate dumplings, red bean buns and mung bean buns. The dumplings were delicate and heavenly.

It was surprising to see all the kitchen staff wear face masks and elaborate hairnets and a very clear emphasis on hygiene.

The crowd grew even more when we left the restaurant at around 6","45pm. There are 4 levels and each level and most diners would prefer to be seated either on the ground level or second floor as there is no lift to the upper floors.We manage to get a table after 15mins wait, as we didnt mind to be seated on the highest level (level 4). The service staff are very friendly and welcoming despite the crowd and stress of getting orders to tables.We ordered a few signature dishes like their Xiao Long Bao, which had thin but firm skin and the broth inside was good, and Fried Rice with Pork Chop that was well fried and yet not oily. I particularly like their soup - I ordered the bittergroud with spare rib soup. The soup was surprisingly refreshing and tasty with all natural flavors. The only disappointment was their drunken chicken, which is an appetizer. It was not marinated correctly and hence, the dish tasted bitter from the overused of alcohol and the chicken meat was very tough.

Having been to many other Taiwanese and Chinese local restaurants I am well aware that these veg dishes and rice are normally less than a quarter of that price. The expensive ones in din tai feng were not in any way superior in quality, in fact the vegetable fried rice was potentially the blandest I've ever tasted.

The drinks menu was also problematic - we ordered the only wine on the menu, which turned out to be more like a spirit and the type of wine used in cooking rather than for enjoying with a meal.

Please definitely try this when you are in Taipei\,,,,,,,2018/4/11, We did not have to wait long for our turn to enter the restaurant. Service was fast and efficient. The service staff even ask if we need help to mix the sauce for the xiaolongbao. Stand was offered to place our bags and a cover was even provided for the jackets. Our tea was refilled without the need to ask. Top notch service indeed!\,,,,,,,2018/4/11, After a 20 minute wait (and filling in the pre-order form) we had a good seat near the prep booth.The xiao long bao was definitely good -- though it lost a few marks on not enough soup inside and the inside filling wasn't the tastiest either.The wonton soup was alright as well.Good to try at least once.\,,,,,,,2018/4/10," The dishes never disappointed me. Always remains a perfectly stable condition. The waiters served fast order with sweet smile. Every time I have no idea of dining out, this is the very first restaurant come up to my mind.

The restaurant is clean and the staff is efficient. The food is delicious. Everything on the menu is reasonably priced, so you can try a lot of different foods. Must get the xlb and beef noodles. I have been to Taipei a couple times, and have visited this restaurant each time and each time was as delicious.\",,,,,,2018/4/4," Sat at the base of Taipei 101 building the restaurant can be busy but there is a good queuing system. We went at 8pm and there was only a 10 minute wait, it had been 20 minutes 2 hours earlier. I'm not a fan of Chinese food in the UK so was surprised I enjoyed the meal so much. There is a wide choice of fillings for the dumplings, including fish and a great choice of side orders.The staff were very helpful, especially the best way to eat the dumplings and what sauces to use. We were the last ones in the restaurant at closing time but never felt rushed. \",,,,,,,2018/4/4," We have eaten at Din Tai Fung in Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Costa Mesa, and now in the original restaurant in Taipei. The food is delicious and consistently that way in every branch we have eaten in. Don't miss their Xiaolongbao, dumplings filled with broth and pork or shrimp, they are wonderful and very fun, if somewhat challenging to eat, it is their signature dish. All of their other dim sum and chinese style dishes are very, very good as well.It's a restaurant not to be missed.\",,,,,,,2018/4/3, Can wait up to an hr if in large group of 3 or more as smaller 2 pax is easier to get seats.

We ordered xiao long bao as recommended by our local friend, some chicken, small dish of noodle. Overall everything is good, but the portion is quite small for 3 of us. The highlighted of this restaurant is service, as long as we get a table, the process from order to serve is really quick.

The food is always fantastic!\",,,,,,,2018/4/1," We were told about this place by a few friends who are veteran Taiwan travelers and admittedly, their praise seemed too effusive. We went to the branch in 101 since each time we walked past one of the other shops in Taipei, the lines were prohibitive. Good sign. We had to wait for a while to be seated, and needed help with the menu. Fortunately, the pictures are helpful and there are English instructions (both for ordering and eating). Service is top notch. Couldn't do better at a Danny Meyer restaurant; everyone is helpful and they are there to get you served and happy and out. So, here's the deal from two novice soup dumpling fans. This is the real deal. Just have xiaolongbao if you're pushed for time (or for carry out). Get more than you think you'll need because you won't leave a single one behind. Little, pillowy, chewy, hot and delicious bundles of flavor. Pork and the crab/pork combo are fabulous. Watch others eat theirs first, if you're uncertain. We also tried the stir-fried pea pod shoots (top 10 vegetable dishes anywhere) and pork buns. There is nothing better. We actually returned although our visit was too short to have a second round.

Please, please, open a branch in NYC.\",,,,,,,2018/4/1, Excellent dumplings opens at 11,"00 am recommend you arrive early as there will be a wait time all dumplings are hand made, they have a viewing where you can see them making the dumplings.

I\'a1\'a6ve been coming here for many years even before it was located at Taipei 101. First thing to say is that there is always a long wait for a table and there is no booking system. You turn up and take a ticket and wait - sometimes two hours! Anyway for a Michelin star restaurant it is surprisingly good value for money and way cheaper than going to TGI or Chilis or somewhere. I love the pork soup dumplings so much I could easily just eat those and nothing else. Like small orgasms inside your mouth! But the beef noodle soup is also divine and the morning glory and bitter melon are also special. It\'a1\'a6s all extremely simple stuff done extremely well and served in a flurry. It\'a1\'a6s a warm friendly place and you can watch the dumplings being made through the window. This is a must visit place when you come to Taipei! I\'a1\'a6ve been to Din Tai Fung in Bangkok Seoul and Shanghai - non were as good as the originals in Taiwan.

Explains the choices if needs be. Provides a large container so you don\'a1\'a6t have to place your purses and bags on the floor. It\'a1\'a6s these little things that make the difference. The XLB are hand-made. Surgical precision, the team dressed all in white, including a face-mask.How to enjoy the Xiao Long Bao\'a1\'58the restaurant provides an easy to follow-card","1. Each place-setting has a small dish of ginger. Stir into it one part soy sauce, three parts vinegar. (the server does that for you.)2. Dip the XLB in the sauce.3. Place XLB in the spoon. Poke a hole in the dumpling to let the broth flow and mix with the sauce. Place some of the ginger on top if you so like.4. Be careful, it will be very hot.5. Enjoy!\",,,,,,2018/3/2," Best dim sum around, try the pork dumplings which is what they're well known for. Fried rice, beef noodles, dumplings, all was excellent. This was a perfect place to have a new years lunch in Taipei. Queue was about a half hour, but well worth the wait.\",,,,,,,2018/3/1," The staffs are nice and the foods are absolutely great! Worth to have a try. Must try out their signature dumpling, xiao long bao\'a1\'a6, fried rice, and beef noodles. Although there is a crowd, it takes quite a short time to be served. \",,,,,,,2018/2/28," We had shao long bao, beef noodles and dan dan noodles for dinner at Din Tai Fung. Despite being extremely crowded, we didnt have to wait long to be seated and for the food. We had a tasty meal and will definitely come back again!\",,,,,,,2018/2/27," We decided to try this place for a final lunch in Taipei and I'm glad we didn't miss it out as it was a great experience. Waiting time was about an hour and then we were taken on a trek through to a table at the back of the restaurant - the dining space was much larger than I had expected! The whole operation is slick and efficient yet very friendly, not impersonal at all. The food was simple, fresh tasting and nicely presented. In a moment of indulgence we had the chocolate xiaolongbao which were delicious. Can't fault the experience at all.\",,,,,,,2018/2/24," Waited for about half an hour. Once our table was ready, service was so efficient . Food excellent as expected.\",,,,,,,2018/2/24, We had a long wait but the service was top notch.We will definitely visit other locations.Don't forget to allow waiting time as this is a popular dinner location.\,,,,,,,2018/2/18, This is my favourite restaurant in Taiwan by a mile. I\'a1\'a6ve been coming here for many years even before it was located at Taipei 101. First thing to say is that there is always a long wait for a table and there is no booking system. You turn up and take a ticket and wait - sometimes two hours! Anyway for a Michelin star restaurant it is surprisingly good value for money and way cheaper than going to TGI or Chilis or somewhere. I love the pork soup dumplings so much I could easily just eat those and nothing else. Like small orgasms inside your mouth! But the beef noodle soup is also divine and the morning glory and bitter melon are also special. It\'a1\'a6s all extremely simple stuff done extremely well and served in a flurry. It\'a1\'a6s a warm friendly place and you can watch the dumplings being made through the window. This is a must visit place when you come to Taipei! I\'a1\'a6ve been to Din Tai Fung in Bangkok Seoul and Shanghai - non were as good as the originals in Taiwan. Unlike years past when it was cash only you can now pay with your plastic! \,,,,,,,2018/2/18," Great food, try visiting at around 3 in the afternoon the wait times aren't that bad. The soup dumplings are very good, as our the beef noodle soup, peanut noodles, cucumber salad....ok everything is very good.\",,,,,,,2018/2/16, Our first try to dine here was on weekend day and it was an mission impossible. Waiting time was very long. Our next try was on the week day at 11,"30am. We got table easily! Staff are extremely kind and spoke English well. We are familiar with DinTaiFung from Singapore but there is no compression between the two. The one in Taipei has great service, excellent food and they did not charge for tea and napkins like they do in Singapore. It was very pleasant experience. We will definitely go again when we visit Taipei. \",,,,,,2018/2/16, We went to this restaurant as friends told us that we had to go there. What we like the best was the services !!!I and my hubby agreed that Din Tai Fung Dumplings or siw long bao at Marina Bay Singapore was much better than here. Services made them taste better. \,,,,,,,2018/2/15," We were curious by the long queue, so we tried it out, their Xio Long Pao and dumplings are good but nothing special.\",,,,,,,2018/2/13," Everything was spot on. Food was excellent and tasty. Service was good, efficient and quick. I got there on a weekday just around 4pm no wait and no issues with seating.

If you notice the badges on the uniform of the staff, it'll show what languages they speak, which is something grand I must say. They are quick to respond to your request and topping up refills for your drinks.Food, sad to say it was much better than the outlets here in Singapore. Portion was bigger, they also had dishes that my country doesn't carry. I would recommend trying Prawn dumpling.TOO DELICIOUS!\",,,,,,2018/2/4, we ate here twice. The dimsums are wonderful. We very much enjoyed these. Apart from the rice with shrimps we do advise to not take any other noodle dishes since they are just not that tasty.\,,,,,,,2018/2/2," We've been to Din Tai Fung in Taipei several times. It is very popular and, whether at 101, Sogo or the original property, you should expect to wait. Sometimes as much as 90 minutes. Best recommendation is to go before main lunch hour or in between lunch and dinner, if possible. Best strategy is to get a number for your party and plan some shopping (window or to purchase) for part of the wait time. Likely the wait will be worth it.The food is very good. Go big and try the truffle soup dumplings if you like truffles. quite the experience. You my also try chocolate dumplings for dessert. All are wonderful. the fried rice is a must. Chicken soup and other dishes are also enjoyable.\",,,,,,,2018/2/1," The food and service at this outlet is very good.

You also dont get the feeling that the place is crowded when inside. Puzzled why the food served to us were not really hot.

The main motivation I guess is that you are eating Taiwanese food in a taiwanese restaurant inside a Taiwan landmark\",,,,,,,2018/1/2, My first meal in Taiwan and the best truffle dumpling I have ever had.

Thanks!\,,,,,,,2018/1/2," Like the original Din Tai Fung this has tremendous queues, which in this case spill out under Tower 101 and into the shopping mall. The food is similarly as good but you don\'a1\'a6t get the historic, slightly rougher environment as it looks and feels like a fast food establishment. The kitchen is the central attraction and you can easily stand for 10-15 minutes watching the chefs make all the dumplings. Staff very helpful if rushed as they try and rush you through as politely as possible \",,,,,,,2018/1/2," This place has a super long wait, so we didn\'a1\'a6t get to dine in. We had to go on the side instead which took less than 15 mins for pick up while the dine in line is 2+ hours wait. Good luck! We just wanted to taste the hype about xiaolongbao, it was...just okay. I think we had better ones else where. \",,,,,,,2018/1/1," The dim sum were good, but it's location was just at 101 Tower basement, so no matter what time you visit, there are always full of people waiting for the seats. The service match with their standard, clean and friendly.\",,,,,,,2017/12/31," It is a long wait for a table here. Suggest you take a number and go shopping but remember to come back in time as they won\'a1\'a6t hold it for you. Plenty of shops around to occupy your time. We had the xiao Long bao, fried rice and an assortment of dishes which were good and of a high quality. Highly recommended. \",,,,,,,2017/12/30, With a friend we visited Din Tai Fung and it was a expericence. First to que in order getting seating. The que was really long but after 40 min We got s table. The meny is not easy to navigate but the service was great.. we just asked for support on what to order. Delicious!\,,,,,,,2017/12/28," I was heared about that many time from my sister before Taiwan visiting in this year. So I managed to try the Xiaolonbao as her recommendation, and it turned out the best dish i ever tasted. Although, a little crowded, but it worth to try\",,,,,,,2018/1/3," Commercially popular already but to xlb addicts and like us who missed dimsums so much, we loved it no matter what overrated they say they are. From their branches all over the world, this is the only branch we have tried and we weren't disappointed. Pricey but we are satisfied. It was always a waiting line but we only waited for less than 10mins.\",,,,,,,2018/1/3," Had to wait about an hour for our table, but that is fine as we just went off and shopped Taipei 101 until our table was ready. It is a big place and they must get through hundreds of people. Service was swift but we didn't feel rushed at all. The soup dumplings really are very good and are a must if you come here, but we also ordered a few other items from the menu and all were very good. Staff were very friendly and I liked the fact that you go and pay at the counter at the end of your meal. All in all, very tasty food at just over \'a2\'4720 per head, one of our favorite restaurant meals in Taipei and we would have gone again if we had time.\",,,,,,,2018/1/3," Long line but is well organized. You also dont get the feeling that the place is crowded when inside. Puzzled why the food served to us were not really hot. Not cold either but we expect a steaming dumpling, hot and sour soup and fried rice . Taste is still good though. The main motivation I guess is that you are eating Taiwanese food in a taiwanese restaurant inside a Taiwan landmark\",,,,,,,2018/1/2, My first meal in Taiwan and the best truffle dumpling I have ever had. Bravo. Given its location it's very busy but the service was phenomenal and we were all thoroughly content. Thanks!\,,,,,,,2018/1/2," Like the original Din Tai Fung this has tremendous queues, which in this case spill out under Tower 101 and into the shopping mall. The food is similarly as good but you don\'a1\'a6t get the historic, slightly rougher environment as it looks and feels like a fast food establishment. The kitchen is the central attraction and you can easily stand for 10-15 minutes watching the chefs make all the dumplings. Staff very helpful if rushed as they try and rush you through as politely as possible \",,,,,,,2018/1/2," This place has a super long wait, so we didn\'a1\'a6t get to dine in. We had to go on the side instead which took less than 15 mins for pick up while the dine in line is 2+ hours wait. Good luck! We just wanted to taste the hype about xiaolongbao, it was...just okay. I think we had better ones else where. \",,,,,,,2018/1/1," The dim sum were good, but it's location was just at 101 Tower basement, so no matter what time you visit, there are always full of people waiting for the seats. The service match with their standard, clean and friendly.\",,,,,,,2017/12/31," It is a long wait for a table here. Suggest you take a number and go shopping but remember to come back in time as they won\'a1\'a6t hold it for you. Plenty of shops around to occupy your time. We had the xiao Long bao, fried rice and an assortment of dishes which were good and of a high quality. Highly recommended. \",,,,,,,2017/12/30, With a friend we visited Din Tai Fung and it was a expericence. First to que in order getting seating. The que was really long but after 40 min We got s table. The meny is not easy to navigate but the service was great.. we just asked for support on what to order.

As in all places the line is long but they have the waiting queue solved via their app which allows you to freely shop around while waiting for your number- the lines are long no matter what time you arrive. I was able to go around 4 floors in Taipei 101 before returning and waiting for 20mins before we were seated to our table. That feat alone we felt like a winner already! The food came in hot and fast with all the servers displaying quick, brisk yet friendly service. I am not removing the app from my phone because the next time I visit them,I know what to expect.\",,,,,,,2017/12/25," Definitely something special, all dishes very good and well prepared. Waiting queue was very long but after we got a seat food came quickly. There are lots of similar places but none beat this.\",,,,,,,2017/12/25," Hate the crowd and the long wait (45 minutes). But too tired to go elsewhere for another restaurant. Place is large but tables are sort of cramped together so that you sit practically with other people by your side. These notwithstanding, the food is still good. So is the price. But service tends to be a bit too much, with different waiting staff constantly pouring tea for you, and taking away empty dishes from all directions, to the point of being a nuisance.\",,,,,,,2017/12/23, Everything is excellent but the reason for being there are the xaiolongbow dumplings! There are written instructions on how to eat them so you get the explosion of broth info your mouth - very special! \,,,,,,,2017/12/23," Having seen waiting times of 60 or even more minutes we decided to go fo early dinner. The food is freshly prepared, very tasty and nice. Service is fast. A bit on the hectic side but the dishes easily make up for that. \",,,,,,,2017/12/22," Worth the queue even it was quite a long one in which it was around 90 minutes of wait. We got a ticket and me and friend went shopping and went back to the Din Tai Fung to look at the 'call number' screen. We got our seat, ordered the food, both food and service was good, recommended.\",,,,,,,2017/12/22, We came here on a group of 4 for dinner. Had to wait around 30 mins which was not too bad considering the forever existing queue here. One thing I have to say here," the service was excellent to the t. The servers were all so attentive and they speak english. My most favourite dish was dumpling in sizhuan sauce and shrimp and pirk shiumay. The xlb tastes the same with the din tai fung branch from my country, I honestly don't think that it is the best xlb I have ever eaten in my life. However, I still think this is an excellent restaurant with solid food. The price here was reasonable, I didnt find it too expensive.\",,,,,,2017/12/22," Its always worth the wait.Food was great, service was fast and staff was attentive and fluent in English and Japanese. She was great.\",,,,,,,2017/12/21, this is a place where everyone goes and everyone meets others they know. No reservations but a number system that puts you in a queue whilst you can shop nearby.

Indicated waiting time was 60min but we decided to wait in order to have a chance to try Din Ti Fung outside of Singapore. The wait last 40min and we were shown to out table promptly. Making order was easy and swift, and dishes were served fast and orderly. We ordered various types of steam dumplings(5 in each type) so that we can try all that were listed in the menu. They were all very delicious. Other dishes from appetizer, noodles, rice and dessert tasted as good as well. We had a great experience dining there. It would have been a 5 stars if not for the long waiting time.\",,,,,,,2017/12/20," Okay, yeah the hype is huge for this restaurant, and being located in Taipei 101 doesn\'a1\'a6t make it easier to get in. We started with the spicy cucumber, and it was delicious! Who\'a1\'a6d have though? We also ordered the Jaja mein, which was surprisingly tasty as well. On to soup dumplings. We had the regular pork and shrimp, crab, and such. I was about to go home rather disappointed as the soup dumplings were \'a1\'a7meh\'a1\'a8, okay but nothing like the hype. Then the pork and truffle soup dumpling arrived. I literally sat erect once I tasted it, my eyes wide with wonder. OMG, this is what people were gaga about! It was well worth the wait to enjoy this truffle and pork soup dumpling. We order 2 more orders after tasting the first order.

Just check the queue numbers flashing on a monitor every now and then to get a good estimate of your waiting time. The turnover is quite fast in part because of the efficient service.The xiaolongbao is a perennial favourite, of course.

There are two lines but with so many people standing around you may not see the difference. The main queue is for those waiting to get seated. Closer to the window there was another queue to get placed on the wait list and assigned a number. The numbers were assigned based on group size," 1-2, 3-6 or 7+. After checking in they gave a printed ticket with my number and a clipboard with a paper order form/menu that I filled out while waiting. One does not need to stay in front of the restaurant waiting area as there is a Starbucks across the way along with a couple of nearby stores. Announcements came quickly as turnover seemed pretty quick. There was also a monitor that you can track the latest number called.Once inside the restaurant there are a lot of seating areas. I crossed in from the the glassed in XLB preparation area and navigated around the customers taking their photos. Once finally seated the waitress took my order form, reviewed it with me and then served me tea. Luckily I did not have to share a table as Solo diners do in other Din Tai Fung restaurants when busy. In a short time my 10 piece Xiao Lin Baos were delivered and they were the right temperature to eat right away. The noodles followed (mix the peanut sauce and noodles on your own) with the spicy won tons with verbal instructions to mix them In the spicy sauce. The noodles were not as flavorful as I remember but the won tons were very good.Service was acceptable this time around. I had to ask for tea a couple of times. Finished dishes were removed timely.

We looked at the menu while waiting so ordered as soon as we were sited and the service was extremely efficient. We ordered around 8 kinds of dumplings and a few side dishes. The truffles dim sum were unique and delicious and worth their price ( 450nt); the desert taro dumplings were also great the other kinds were ok but not too special and the side dishes ok but not impressive. The open kitchen was fun to watch and the atmosphere festive but the food did not live up to the (indeed rather high) expectations.

It boasts the best service along with most delicious food, and even local people like myself enjoy the relatively expensive restaurant once in a year.The most famous dish at the restaurant is of course the Xiao Lung Bao (\'a4\'70\'c5\'a2\'a5\'5d), which is a Northern Chinese Dumpling made with pork meat wrapped in thinly made wheat wrappings. It melts in your mouth, not in your hands (even though no one eats Chinese food with bare hands, unlike your M&Ms), but just be careful not to eat it all at once, because the delicious juice in the baozhi will be a bit hot.I also enjoy the various kinds of Northern Chinese food there, including \'bd\'b5\'aa\'6f\'bb\'e6 (green onion pizza), \'bb\'5d\'bb\'e5 (steamed dumplings), \'c4\'d1\'ad\'b9 (various types of noodles), and the delicious appetizer called \'a8\'a7\'a8\'46\'a5\'5d (sweet baozhi). It will take more than 10 pages to list all the food there, but you won't regret a penny spent there. Also try the \'bb\'c4\'bb\'b6\'b4\'f6 (sweet and sour soup) if you haven't tried it anywhere else on our Beautiful Formosan Island.All in all, Din Tai Fung will have a long line, unless you choose to visit during weekday lunches. If you need a local guide on weekends, feel free to message me.I am a certified tour guide in Taiwan, even though I am actually studying Buddhism on weekdays in Yilan County's Jiaoxi.Have fun, enjoy the food, and if you really loved the service, please feel free to tip the adorable waitresses and handsome waiters. They are all rookies, climbing the social ladder, and would love your compliment on their food, their services, and their smiles.Just don't try to ask for their phone numbers, because it is a company policy not to, unless you are Brad Pitt.

One of the things that impressed me most is how efficient they were. There was a long line out front. You take a number, they hand you a menu. It didn't take long for our number to be called; we were whisked quickly to a clean table. By the time we sat down, we were ready to order and handed the order paper to the server. Food came out soon after. I didn't feel rushed. I felt satisfied and ready to take on more of taipei.\",,,,,,,2017/10/24," Just like almost all the others, I had lunch here after visiting Taipei 101. I was really looking forward to it ... even watched a few YouTube videos to prepare myself. It comes down to this def try the soup dumplings (that\'a1\'a6s what they\'a1\'a6re known for) but then get what ever peeks your curiosity. I was a little disappointed with the \'a1\'a5fans favorites\'a1\'a6 but the shrimp fried rice was very impressive (ask for the hot chili oil). The whole experience is just that \'a1\'a5an experience\'a1\'a6 so that you can cross it off your list as a must do when in Taipei. \",,,,,,,2017/10/22, In Taipei on business. Always stop by Din Tai Fung if possible. I gorge on pork and shrimp dumplings like Kung Fu Panda! Make sure to get the spicy pickled cucumbers too. \,,,,,,,2017/10/21, This is a great restaurant! The dumplings are the best. We went during the afternoon so it was only a 5 min. wait. \,,,,,,,2017/10/19," I was on a tour with about 15 other people. After a week around the island, our final day was around Taipei. We spent the drizzly day seeing sights all around the Taipei area, but made our way to Taipei 101. We had tickets for and headed up to the observatory (see my other reviews), which was great. We then came back down and found our way to Din Tai Fung, the ""dumpling restaurant"". We go the the restaurant/mall floor, and it was packed with people. Our guide gave us 10 minutes to wander while she found out how long the wait was. We grabbed a couple food souvenirs (we love the pineapple cakes), and came back to find they could seat us right away. This is a HUGE restaurant. We worked our way towards the back, and walked right by the kitchen viewing area, which was really cool. About 20 prep cooks worked feverishly making dumplings, bao, and truffles. A nice young lady came by to tell onlookers about it. I remember she said, ""18 folds, no more, no less, and 21 grams, no more, no less"". Very impressive. We sat, and our group ordered as a group. I can't say exactly what all we had, as I am not a big dim sum fan nor much of a seafood fan (I know, wrong place, right), but I was one happy camper. These were amazing. There was chicken, pork, shrimp, fish, and veggie fare. Plus there were veggie, meat and rice side dishes. There was NOTHING left on our table, which was a first for this group's weeklong Taiwan adventures. I'd eat there again in a hearbeat. Good food. Fun. And while they say there is up to about a half hour wait, with so many tables, the line moves pretty fast.\",,,,,,,2017/10/19," Extremely professional staff, delicious food and unique.

So they asked us to look for the food we want already. While choosing we got some help from one of the Staff memebers which was really friendly, actually all of them are super nice and helpfull. Waiting time turned out as approx 10min so they are really efficient. The food was really good. All we ordered was super delicious, the dumplings are fantastic. You can watch how they produce them as well. It is definatly worth to wait even if it is longer than the 10min.\",,,,,,,2017/10/18, Arrived at this restaurant only to find a large crowd.

I would highly recommend this experience.\,,,,,,,2017/10/17, It's like a dim sum factory but everything was good and fast and worth the 20min waiting (specially cause they said it would be 40) Very good price and excellent service always very kind and fast.

It will move faster than you think and they are extremely efficient. Just watch for your number to appear on the board. It's brilliant that they break it down into table size for maximum efficiency. 3. Make sure you follow the instruction sheet on how to prepare/eat the xiaolongbao. Don't just dig in.

You can watch the dim sum being made in the kitchen through a glass screen to see the dexterity of the chefs and the lengths they go to to ensure a consistent product. The menu appeared similar to that in Hong Kong but there were a few differences. However, one thing for sure was that there was no difference in the quality of the product which was fabulous.

The menu is quite long and extensive so come with an empty stomach so that you can try as many dishes as possible. Quality control for a Din tai Fung establishment is very controlled .

Everything taste fresh and wonderful.\",,,,,,,2017/8/8," I need to admit that I do know the Owner of Din Tai Fung Mr Yang but I'm writing this review in an objective way. I love the food there whether it's their famous Xiaolongbao or sweet & sour soup or rice cakes or spicy dumplings sonon and so forth. But the most painful things of eating there firstly it's the long long queue and hence long waiting time (especially during lunch hours) and then their environment which is always very crowded and relatively small (seeing their original Xinyi shop). So what I meant is despite their quality and specialty of food I find it sometimes very difficult to enjoy in such an environment (overseas branches are mostly better)...However, this Taipei 101 branch is definitely the biggest and very spacious.

This branch accepts reservations for groups (we were 30), you just have to inform your tour operator in advance. We also placed our orders in advance, as I remember it was required. Even though we had prior reservation there still was a long line at the entrance. I guess even the locals love this restaurant. We had to wait a good 15-20 mins before we were showed to our tables. The tour operator asked us how we wanted our food served, either the traditional way where the food would be served with all the ceremony, or the westernized way. We chose the latter, where food was served altogether and as fast as possible, since we were all hungry and excited about the various flavors of their famous xiao long bao. Food quality is very good, so was the serving size. Service was fast although not all of them could communicate in English, but that was not a problem since most of them are used to foreigners, and they referred us to the staff who knew.We surely enjoyed the dinner and we had so much excess food to take to the hotel. I guess we over ordered. After dinner we had time to go around Taipei 101 to check out the high end shops, and enjoyed Jasons Market Place as well which is located at the side of the restaurant.

First of all, the looong line may be intimidating, but let me assure you, time will fly fast and it will be worth the wait. We got our queue number first (there were 25 tables ahead of us) and actually went to the food court right beside to have a bowl of beef noodle soup. And then we also looked around at the supermarket adjacent to the restaurant. Lo and behold, when we went back to the restaurant, our number was actually called already! But since their customer service was excellent, they allowed us to still enter. For a restaurant with so many diners, you'd expect orders to take some time and the place to be at least crowded and slightly messy. But the restaurant felt very spacious and clean and the orders came out faster than most restaurants! Talk about the world-class managament of the restaurant. As for the food, despite the xiao long bao (XLB) being ordered in perhaps each and every table, every piece was still carefully crafted and the thickness of the skin was just right such that the soup does not easily flow out of the skin. There are many XLB shops that sell thick-skinned XLBs which is a major turn-off for me, but Din Tai Fung has perfected its craft. \",,,,,,,2017/6/24," Good ! Good ! Good!That's the only words i would say. Just focus & enjoy the meals, and you won't regret!\",,,,,,,2017/6/22, We've first tried Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong and the experience was even better in Taipei. I loved the app that allowed you to see how long the wait was as well as notifying you when your table was ready. Plus you order while you wait so once you get your table the food follows in short order. \,,,,,,,2017/6/22," Worth the wait. Worth every penny. This restaurant is very very good. if you want good dimsum (xiao long bao) and good food in general, go to this restaurant. sometimes it may have a lot of people on queue but its worth the wait. I tasted the Din Tai Fung in my country but its different. the food here is so much flavorful. If you cannot speak chinese, some of the staff can converse well in english.\",,,,,,,2017/6/22, Must eat place when visiting Taipei. There is less of a crowd at lunch vs. dinner. Don't forget to order the chocolate dumplings for dessert. \,,,,,,,2017/6/21," I was taken here by my work colleages in Taiwan, the food and service is amazing we were taken and shown how the dumplings were made, we had a wonderful time.\",,,,,,,2017/6/20, There was a long waiting line during our visit it was worth the wait. Din Tai Fung's world-famous xiao long bao are really the best. The pork buns were delicious as well. The wait staff were very attentive to our needs and our glasses were always full. The restaurant's location right at Taipei 101 makes visiting very convenient.\,,,,,,,2017/6/20," We went there after touring the observation deck. There was already a line about 10 mins before the place opened. It was well worth the wait though. The soup dumplings were simply awesome. Skip the sauce just taste the meat juice as is. I have been to the one in Singapore, but remember it to be only so-so. This location IMO is way better. Also, I think their shao-mai is only ok. I prefer the more traditional ones that you can get at dim sum restaurants. I can eat the soup dumplings all day it's that good.\",,,,,,,2017/6/19," This is on my bucket list to do in Taipei because it's so famous for their xialongbao. This place is located just below Taipei 101 and you will see it immediately when you exited the tunnel - it will be your right. To enter the restaurant, you have to go through the doors right in front of you that leads you to the basement of Taipei 101 building. We got here at 10","30 am and there's already a line. They give you the menu and the order form while you were waiting and once you were sitted, the orders start coming. They even give you instructions on how to eat the xialongbao. So for beginners we ordered 10 pork xialongbao, 3 with truffles, 10 pork with vegetables, and 10 with crab. The pork one was the best and we ended up ordering more because the xialongbao are bite-size pieces more like an appetizer). So we ordered 10 more of the pork, 10 pork shumai, 2 red bean buns, and a plate of shrimp fried rice. So the pork xialongbao is still the best followed by the truffles and the shrimp fried rice. My total came up to 2k NTD which is about $70 USD. We ordered a lot because we (a family of 3 with a teenager) didn't eat breakfast so this was our brunch. One bucket list checked.\",,,,,,2017/6/16," very crowded with customers but fast..the dumplings soup, shrimp dumplings and xiao long bao are nice..we enjoyed our food there.\",,,,,,,2017/6/25," What else can be said? First of all, the looong line may be intimidating, but let me assure you, time will fly fast and it will be worth the wait. We got our queue number first (there were 25 tables ahead of us) and actually went to the food court right beside to have a bowl of beef noodle soup. And then we also looked around at the supermarket adjacent to the restaurant. Lo and behold, when we went back to the restaurant, our number was actually called already! But since their customer service was excellent, they allowed us to still enter. For a restaurant with so many diners, you'd expect orders to take some time and the place to be at least crowded and slightly messy. But the restaurant felt very spacious and clean and the orders came out faster than most restaurants! Talk about the world-class managament of the restaurant. As for the food, despite the xiao long bao (XLB) being ordered in perhaps each and every table, every piece was still carefully crafted and the thickness of the skin was just right such that the soup does not easily flow out of the skin. There are many XLB shops that sell thick-skinned XLBs which is a major turn-off for me, but Din Tai Fung has perfected its craft. \",,,,,,,2017/6/24," Good ! Good ! Good!That's the only words i would say. Just focus & enjoy the meals, and you won't regret!\",,,,,,,2017/6/22, We've first tried Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong and the experience was even better in Taipei. I loved the app that allowed you to see how long the wait was as well as notifying you when your table was ready. Plus you order while you wait so once you get your table the food follows in short order. \,,,,,,,2017/6/22," Worth the wait. Worth every penny. This restaurant is very very good. if you want good dimsum (xiao long bao) and good food in general, go to this restaurant. sometimes it may have a lot of people on queue but its worth the wait.

As expected, the xiao long bao was exceptional - very flavorful. We ordered a lot and enjoyed most of it - the chicken marinated in wine was not for our taste palate since it was kind of bitter. The pork chop that came with the fried rice was juicy and very tasty as well. Too bad the sauteed string beans was not available.

Very clean and well organized with lots of helpful happy staff. Nice menu with lots of choices but of course you must order the soup dumplings. You fill out your menu request on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant and hand it to one of the attendants. So nice we actually returned twice for more. There are several locations in the city. This is a chain Also popular in San Jose. \,,,,,,,2017/6/3, Amazing soup dumplings at several variations. Made fresh right there for you to watch. Avoid rush hour ad they do not take reservations and wait time could be over an hour! App tells you when your turn is up so you can go for a walk at Taipei 101 while you wait. \,,,,,,,2017/6/3," We had been hearing good reviews on this restuarant, especially its siao long pao that we decided to try it out ourselves. The queues were endless during lunchtime that we ended up going to other place for lunch and came back later in the afternoon for snack.We ate siao long pao, its bestseller and indeed it did not disappoint. The siao long pao did not easily broke out when you picked it up with chopsticks unlike in other restuarants that we had eaten. It tasted delicious and authentic with soup inside. It indeed made you remember the distinct taste of Taiwan. Added bonus was the good service from their staffs. They would always fill our cups with house tea and had provided a rack to put our things so we would be more comfortable eating our food. A very pleasurable Taiwan gastronomic experience!\",,,,,,,2017/6/2," Its actually one of the more affordable options in Taipei 101, just prepare for a long line to get in. But honestly, its more than worth it. People will tell you that there are also other places you can get Xiaolongbao in the area, and they are just as good? i took the liberty to stuff myself with as much xiaolongbao as i can get away with while in taipei, and i can honestly say, this one is the best. \",,,,,,,2017/6/2, This place is well known all over Asia. Be prepared to wait 30 mins but it's worth it. Top notch everything. Go!\,,,,,,,2017/6/2," My friend loves this place and goes each time she is in Taipei. I was skeptical at first, but it was her treat, so I was all up for it. This location was inside a fancy mall and the space is huge. We went a bit early, at 1130 am, because it is known to have long lineups, even though this restaurant is large and has different locations. Apparently it is less busy on weekdays lunch times and has ridiculous waits on weekends and dinner times.The decor was very clean and a bit formal. It is on the upscale end, so the prices and service reflects this. The service was fantastic, with many servers about for anything we needed and were very attentive. We ordered a variety of ""soup"" dumplings, from the standard pork, shrimp, crab, lobster, pork and vegetables, and chicken, just to try a bunch. We also ordered a vegetable dish to balance all the carbs and meat.I don't remember the price we paid, but our bill was probably more than $100. The two sauces to make our dipping sauce mixed was so delicious on its own and perfect for dunking the dumplings and drenching it! The ginger provided was very thinly shredded, giving a mild ginger taste. We love ginger, so we asked for a couple extra bowls of it.The pork dumplings were really juicy, perfectly seasoned, on the slightly savoury side, and so heavenly delicious. The dough was very soft and thin, making it nicely, slightly, chewy; a great texture to compliment the deliciously soft pork and juices! By rating the most to least favourite, by far the pork was a favourite and we order it 3 more times. Then it is the lobster, crab, shrimp, chicken, and least favourite is the pork with vegetable.The lobster was so tasty with lots of real lobster and perfectly seasoned. Of course it was the most expensive, so we only had one set. The crab one was pretty good too, lots of crab and well seasoned. The shrimp dumplings were really delicious as well with yummy seasoning. The chicken was pretty good too, less in comparison to the seafood ones. The pork with vegetable was our least favourite because the vegetable ruined the pork flavour for us and seemed out of place. The dumplings all tasted great on its own and with the sauce, though the pork with vegetable one needed to be mostly be dipped in the sauce and ginger to make it taste better. It's great to have a variety of taste and texture. We tried to order a couple of sets at a time so we can eat it while it's hot. That's when it tastes the best. Once it cools down, the dough becomes a bit dry and firmer, which happened to a few of our dumplings.The vegetables we ordered on the side we pretty good too, nice and crunchy, but I found it too garlicky. Dipping it into the mixed sauce gave it a better flavour. Overall, this is a must visit place for dumplings, especially the pork dumplings. It is a foodie heaven! I highly recommend it and would love to visit again, now that I know what to order. \",,,,,,,2017/6/1," Visited for lunch. Very busy. Get a ticket and then wait. They were advising a 50 min wait for eating in. Ours was more like thirty. Note that your ticket number will start with your party size (1 = 1 - 2 people, etc.) and that the screen displays separate numbers for each party size. All very efficient. Pleasant English speaking lady helped us order whilst we waited. Order gets plugged into the system in advance so, once you have a table, it's all very quick.Food wise, I'd say good not great. They are supposed to be famous for their soup filled dumplings (aka Shanghai dumplings). We've had better in New York and Shanghai - and had better Dim sum in London.

In comparison to other major Asian cities, it delivers the same high quality that people expect! The dumplings, pork chop, and spivey green beans are my favourite! If you want good food and expect high quality, you must go.,,\",,,,,,,2017/5/26, The Sau long pau is just yummy! So different from those I tasted back in Malaysia. The fried rice according to my hubby is a bomb. I didn't taste it as I was enjoying the sweet sour soup. The other dishes were good too. But portion was rather small.\,,,,,,,2017/5/25," If you visit Taipei, it is a must-go! My girlfriend and I enjoyed soup dumplings and the vegetable/meat wonton soup. Go before noon to avoid crowds otherwise, you have to wait for a long time. We went there around 11",30 am so we did not really have to wait.\,,,,,,2017/5/25," Not to miss a visit to any branch of this restaurant.Dumplings and local specialties . Not too expensive, clean and good service. \",,,,,,,2017/5/24," Despite this being a chain restaurant, the service and food and excellent. It is always busy, whether it is the weekday or weekend. You get a number to queue (different queues for different number of people per table). The waitresses give you a menu so you can order first before you are seated. The food is delivered very quickly and cooked to order.\",,,,,,,2017/5/24," Definitely worth going! We had our usuals, for comparison, and we must say the food is better! Probably due to the availability of fresh stock in Taiwan rather than frozen meat. \",,,,,,,2017/5/23," Of course, the main star of this place, xiao long bao, was exceptional. It is definitely a must try when you're in Din Tai Fung in Taipei! But what stood out was the amazing service.. as usual, this place was packed.. even on a Wednesday night. But the waiter took his time to seat us and explain the menu to us. And he even brought out a little handbag case thing so my sister could put her handbag in a secure place while we enjoyed our food instead of clutching it on her lap! It was also extremely good value for money. But be prepared to wait as the queue can be quite long. For the two of us on a Wednesday at about 7-7.30pm we waited around half an hour. The location was also convenient as it was the day we went to Taipei 101. DTF was definitely an experience worth trying, especially on holiday!\",,,,,,,2017/5/22," If you love dumplings, or xiao long bao, this is definitely the place to go. The original is located in Dongmen Station off the red line MRT. If you have time, you must check out the original one. However, the one in Taipei 101 is good also. The wait can sometimes take up to an hour so you need to be patient. While you wait, you can stroll around Taipei 101 as they will give you a number card so you do not have to sit there and wait. Furthermore, you can see the chefs make your dumplings through a glass window next to the restaurant. This is also a Michelin one star restaurant. One of the MUST GO places in Taiwan for some authentic Xiao Long Bao. \",,,,,,,2017/5/20," This place a is quite crowded so we shared a table with several other tourists. The food was very good, but not as nice as their location in Hong Kong. Service was good. Price offers a good value and the food was prepared well.\",,,,,,,2017/5/19," When I visited the restaurant without reservation, I waited 30 minutes less than I thought.I ordered 10 dishes and mostly the food was good and reasonable price. Staff were kind and systemically.\",,,,,,,2017/5/28," Well, the consistent excellence of Din Tai Fung is going strong! In comparison to other major Asian cities, it delivers the same high quality that people expect! The dumplings, pork chop, and spivey green beans are my favourite! If you want good food and expect high quality, you must go.,,\",,,,,,,2017/5/26, The Sau long pau is just yummy! So different from those I tasted back in Malaysia. The fried rice according to my hubby is a bomb. I didn't taste it as I was enjoying the sweet sour soup. The other dishes were good too. But portion was rather small.\,,,,,,,2017/5/25," If you visit Taipei, it is a must-go! My girlfriend and I enjoyed soup dumplings and the vegetable/meat wonton soup. Go before noon to avoid crowds otherwise, you have to wait for a long time. We went there around 11",30 am so we did not really have to wait.\,,,,,,2017/5/25," Not to miss a visit to any branch of this restaurant.Dumplings and local specialties . Not too expensive, clean and good service. \",,,,,,,2017/5/24," Despite this being a chain restaurant, the service and food and excellent. It is always busy, whether it is the weekday or weekend. You get a number to queue (different queues for different number of people per table). The waitresses give you a menu so you can order first before you are seated. The food is delivered very quickly and cooked to order.\",,,,,,,2017/5/24," Definitely worth going! We had our usuals, for comparison, and we must say the food is better! Probably due to the availability of fresh stock in Taiwan rather than frozen meat. \",,,,,,,2017/5/23," Of course, the main star of this place, xiao long bao, was exceptional. It is definitely a must try when you're in Din Tai Fung in Taipei! But what stood out was the amazing service.. as usual, this place was packed.. even on a Wednesday night. But the waiter took his time to seat us and explain the menu to us. And he even brought out a little handbag case thing so my sister could put her handbag in a secure place while we enjoyed our food instead of clutching it on her lap! It was also extremely good value for money. But be prepared to wait as the queue can be quite long. For the two of us on a Wednesday at about 7-7.30pm we waited around half an hour. The location was also convenient as it was the day we went to Taipei 101. DTF was definitely an experience worth trying, especially on holiday!\",,,,,,,2017/5/22," If you love dumplings, or xiao long bao, this is definitely the place to go. The original is located in Dongmen Station off the red line MRT. If you have time, you must check out the original one. However, the one in Taipei 101 is good also. The wait can sometimes take up to an hour so you need to be patient. While you wait, you can stroll around Taipei 101 as they will give you a number card so you do not have to sit there and wait. Furthermore, you can see the chefs make your dumplings through a glass window next to the restaurant. This is also a Michelin one star restaurant. One of the MUST GO places in Taiwan for some authentic Xiao Long Bao. \",,,,,,,2017/5/20," This place a is quite crowded so we shared a table with several other tourists. The food was very good, but not as nice as their location in Hong Kong. Service was good. Price offers a good value and the food was prepared well.\",,,,,,,2017/5/19," When I visited the restaurant without reservation, I waited 30 minutes less than I thought.I ordered 10 dishes and mostly the food was good and reasonable price. Staff were kind and systemically.\",,,,,,,2017/5/18, We had to try Din Tai Fung as it is legendary. Michelin starred and affordable is right up our alley and we were happy to wait the 20 minutes for lunch which I've heard is nothing compared to their normal wait times. Everything we tried was perfect and of course their xiao long bat with pork and veggies was ah-ma-zing! Their shrimp was just as delicious. Their chicken soup was meaty and broth was good. Pork chop with fried rice was a good portion and complimented each other. Spicy dumplings were good also. Their house special and cucumbers were very good accompaniments. \,,,,,,,2017/5/17, The restaurant was very busy being situated inside the Taipei 101 building. The queue is long but definitely worth the wait. Tables and waiting times depends on the number of people in your group. Din Tai Fung has the best dim sum!!! They are so full of flavor. You can watch them make the dim sum through a glass divider and the dim sum is folded 18 times. Celebrities visited this establishment to tried and make them. So don't be surprised if you see Tom Cruise in there ;)\,,,,,,,2017/5/17, Seriously excelent soup dumplings served by funny squeaking speaking girls... i m not kidding about both of them ,p \,,,,,,2017/5/17, Need to go early as it very crowded. The food standard is good and the service staff is attentive as they have many manpower in the restaurants.\,,,,,,,2017/5/17," An experience in Taiwainese food. Delish. Just go and order the xianlong bao. Clean, efficient, tasty, reasonably priced.\",,,,,,,2017/5/16," If you like soup dumplings, then a Din Tai Fung is a ""must visit"" for you!The soup dumplings are incredible. My favourite being the truffle infused soup dumplings. Food is reasonably priced for the quality. My only critique is that it is super-crowded a and your dining experience can feel rushed m, even the staff are friend and very efficient.\",,,,,,,2017/5/15, Din Tai Fung is by far the greatest dumplings I have had. They are so tasty and to remember for. If you get the chance you should try the truffle dumpling! They are so good! The line is a little long we had to wait more than 40 min but it was definitely worth the wait.\,,,,,,,2017/5/15," I never thought truffle would go together with xiaolongbao, but it is such a perfect combination. Smell of truffle mixed with juicy pork filling is heaven. Other dishes were ok. Be aware that there is a long line. We went there around 7pm and it was like 25 tables to go. But we only wait less than half and hour, thumb up for management. Taipei 101 Branch is the easiest to find, it is right by the entrance of Taipei 101 tower by MRT.\",,,,,,,2017/5/14," In the first day at Taipei after finish visiting National museum I come back to 101 Taipei and have dinner at this Restaurant. You will have to wait for table because there are many customers but it not take too much time. It take me about 20 minute for a table for 4 people. This Restaurant is in B1 Floor of 101 Taipei. First I meet the staff at the door to choose Table, there are 3 kind of table for one person , for 4 person ang a big group. The waiting time is belong to the kind of table you choose. The traditional food is very good and delicious that you must try. About 80 to 350 Taiwan dollar for one bowl steamed fish Dumpling, Shrimp and Pork Pot Stickers... we pay 2.205 $ Taipei money for 4 person and full with dinner. This is a Traditional style of Taipei \",,,,,,,2017/5/13," I tried Din Tai Fung in Singapore, and Taipei 101 branch is even better. First of all the service is quite impressive, although very crowded, but they have systematic way to arrange your sit. I suggest you collect your number about an hour in advanced. Waitresses are very friendly and never tired to explain their dishes and served me well. Besides I found they are compable to communicate in English and Japanese too. I tried the signature dumplings and fried rice, both were superb. Even better they offered me smaller portion of fried rice since they saw I came in solo and worried I cannot finish it, for this initiative I can't find it in Din Tai Fung Singapore. Well done!

Since I was visiting Taipei 101, I thought it was a good opportunity to eat at Din Tai Fung there. The food and service didn't disappoint. There are 2 queues at the entrance for getting a number ticket - one for tour groups and the other for normal customers. The queue for normal customers is not that long.

It is best to reserve before you become hungry as the queue is long. While waiting for our turn to be seated we walked around taipei 101. The aircon is cooler inside the resto compared to the mall's.

Very busy restaurant, hence advanced reservation is recommended to avoid long queue.\",,,,,,,2017/4/20," A long wait so I'd advise you to register and collect your number before you wander round the shops. We ended up ordering far too much food as we needed to try food that we had missed last time (2 years ago) plus the favourites from the last time. However, we managed to get through most of it. Get small portions of your favourites and don't don't forget the pot stickers, they are fab! The food does stay hot so take your time and enjoy it.

The service is THE BEST, the Xiao long bao IS THE BEST!You are not gonna be disappointed for sure! My husband who's very picky with his food LOVES and REQUESTED to go to Din Tai Fung every time we visit Taiwan! They are also very organized and efficient, there's always a wait but there's also a lot that you can see and buy at the same level of the Taipei 101 to kill time!\",,,,,,,2017/4/19," I believe this is one of the best branch in Taipei.

The queue may be long but an orderly system is in place depending on how big is your party. The xiao long pow is the main item in addition to many other delicious buns and typical Taiwanese cuisine like noodles, rice etc. The service is top notch but although I speak Mandarin to the staff, they invariably reply in English (chance to practise). You can watch the food being prepared through the glass enclosure and see the dedication to their work on their faces. Overall, a very delightful experience.\",,,,,,,2017/4/15," Delicious food.Do not miss to order their xiao lom pao (dumpling with soup inside). Put the dumpling on the soup spoon so that it would be easy to bite / eat. If you bite it in half, the soup will spill. So it is best to put the whole dumpling into the mouth. \",,,,,,,2017/4/15," Do not get discouraged by the long waiting line as it magically shrinks thanks to their fast almost military system of ordering food.Within no time you'll be dropping your jaw as you pass by their amazing kitchen on your way to your table. It is nothing short of a cullinary show! Feel free to take pictures! The only downside to their menu is that you won't be able to eat it all. The cullinary artistry of their famous dumplings are truly great and do follow the eating instructions of the friendly staff in order to fully enjoy this cullinary experience. Their fish ,soup and deserts are also worthy of the Din Tai Fung name and the dumplings certainly live up to expectations, although if you are an asian food conosseur they might not be the best you've ever had.The speed at which they refill your almost perfectly brewed tea is enough to wash down the dumplings and make room for more food! Worth a visit... or two!!\",,,,,,,2017/4/22, The queue on a weekday for 3pax is only 10 mins. We got our seats pretty fast which makes us real surprised.

Spacious with fast service and some extremely talented chefs who pleat all the dumplings beautifully, go and watch them, they are fast!\",,,,,,,2017/4/19," Ok there are many Din Tai Fung restaurants at different countries, but THIS IS THE BEST!!! The service is THE BEST, the Xiao long bao IS THE BEST!You are not gonna be disappointed for sure! My husband who's very picky with his food LOVES and REQUESTED to go to Din Tai Fung every time we visit Taiwan! They are also very organized and efficient, there's always a wait but there's also a lot that you can see and buy at the same level of the Taipei 101 to kill time!\",,,,,,,2017/4/19," I believe this is one of the best branch in Taipei. The food is nice, the seats are spacious. Just be prepare for the queue. You may need to get a seat reservation number an hour before hand.\",,,,,,,2017/4/16," A 1 star michellin star restaurant with very reasonable price!Even though they are famous for the dumplings but you must try their fried rice, best I've tried so far!Any of their branch restaurants is good.\",,,,,,,2017/4/16," The place is a must visit. The queue may be long but an orderly system is in place depending on how big is your party. The xiao long pow is the main item in addition to many other delicious buns and typical Taiwanese cuisine like noodles, rice etc. The service is top notch but although I speak Mandarin to the staff, they invariably reply in English (chance to practise). You can watch the food being prepared through the glass enclosure and see the dedication to their work on their faces. Overall, a very delightful experience.\",,,,,,,2017/4/15," Delicious food.Do not miss to order their xiao lom pao (dumpling with soup inside). Put the dumpling on the soup spoon so that it would be easy to bite / eat. If you bite it in half, the soup will spill. So it is best to put the whole dumpling into the mouth. \",,,,,,,2017/4/15," Do not get discouraged by the long waiting line as it magically shrinks thanks to their fast almost military system of ordering food.Within no time you'll be dropping your jaw as you pass by their amazing kitchen on your way to your table. It is nothing short of a cullinary show! Feel free to take pictures! The only downside to their menu is that you won't be able to eat it all. The cullinary artistry of their famous dumplings are truly great and do follow the eating instructions of the friendly staff in order to fully enjoy this cullinary experience. Their fish ,soup and deserts are also worthy of the Din Tai Fung name and the dumplings certainly live up to expectations, although if you are an asian food conosseur they might not be the best you've ever had.The speed at which they refill your almost perfectly brewed tea is enough to wash down the dumplings and make room for more food! Worth a visit... or two!!\",,,,,,,2017/4/14," Travel blogs and friends have contrasting opinions on whether or not one should add a visit to Din Tai Fung in an itinerary for Taipei. On one hand, people are saying that it\'a1\'a6s a must-try as the Taipei 101 branch serves up exceptional fare. On the other, people are saying that it\'a1\'a6s not worth one\'a1\'a6s time especially since Din Tai Fung already has a local presence in the Philippines. Prior to flying to Taiwan, I\'a1\'a6d have to say that I took on the more pragmatic skip-Din-Tai-Fung mentality. However, upon the insistence of our wickedly awesome Taiwan tour guide, Xiao Huang, we ended up having lunch there anyway.The waiting time for us to be seated was around 45 minutes. It may not have provided seats for diners in queue such as what the SM Megamall branch does; however, it\'a1\'a6s situated right across a row of interesting souvenir shops and kiosks selling Taiwanese delicacies perfect for pasalubong that would keep you entertained while waiting.Its menu definitely features more options than the one in Manila, so choosing what to order may take a little longer. However, let\'a1\'a6s be real. Everyone went here for the Xiao Long Baos (TWD 210/10 pieces), and they were beyond exceptional! The soup alone is a winner. Infused with so much umami, the soup becomes a prized commodity of which each drop seems to be sacred. To be honest, I\'a1\'a6m not really a big fan of the Xiao Long Bao\'a1\'a6s served by Din Tai Fung Manila. I actually prefer those served by Paradise Dynasty, Modern Shanghai, and Shi Lin! However, these were definitely something else!Of course, not everything on the menu tasted far from Manila\'a1\'a6s. Taipei\'a1\'a6s versions of the Fried Pork Chop (TWD 130) and the Braised Beef Noodle Soup (TWD 250) were as underwhelming as those served in Manila\'a1\'a6s. Smarter choices for appetizers would be the Shaohsing Wine Marinated Chicken(TWD 300) and the Shrimp and Pork Pot Stickers (TWD 190/6pcs). The former is a subtle-tasting cold appetizer which features delicately prepared and marinated slices of chicken, while the latter (though sloppily and lazily plated) boasted of tremendously juicy dumplings!What I love about eating in Taiwan is that their vegetables are unbelievably fresh, crunchy, and have an innate sweetness to them. We ordered two types of vegetable dishes for this meal. The first would be the Sauteed String Beans with Minced Pork (TWD 130), a staple in Taiwanese cuisine. There was nothing really noteworthy about this dish if it weren\'a1\'a6t for the quality of the beans themselves. The second vegetable dish was the showstopper between the two. The Stir Fried Bird\'a1\'a6s Nest Fern (TWD 300) wins primarily on the novelty factor. It was my first time trying this vegetable, so that already made it more interesting. Apart from the dish tasting absolutely delicious, it also came with curious-looking delicious caper-like substances that I still have yet to identify until today!Who knew that Shrimp Fried Rice (TWD 230) would be interesting enough to be talked about? However, Din Tai Fung\'a1\'a6s Shrimp Fried Rice definitely deserves some credit. This glistening heap of fried rice was a meal on its own. I don\'a1\'a6t know what oil they used, but boy did it make the fried rice so tasty! Glistening as it may be, it\'a1\'a6s definitely not oily so you wouldn\'a1\'a6t have to worry about that undesirable sensation of oil on your lips.I\'a1\'a6m known to be quite partial towards any type of noodles paired with minced pork (Tantanmen, anyone)? However, Din Tai Fung\'a1\'a6s Noodles with Minced Pork Sauce (TWD 130) was definitely the bomb! I think I almost finished an entire bowl of this dish on my own. I was simply in heaven. I think what sets it apart from other minced pork noodle dishes was that it tossed in chunks of sweet Chinese Sausage which gave the dish an interesting kick of cured sweetness.All I have to say is that I\'a1\'a6m just so fortunate that we ended up listening to Xiao Huang\'a1\'a6s suggestion. Dining in Din Tai Fung \'a1\'56 Taipei 101 branch is definitely NOT overrated. It\'a1\'a6s a must-try experience (even if you ate in its offshore branches countless of times). I guess Taiwanese food simply tastes better in Taiwan!\",,,,,,,2017/4/13," I took my customer to taste for the first time the dumplings. The atmosphere is very nice, you can see how they make the dumplings and they are superb. The service is great with free water and tea they pass and refill how much you want\",,,,,,,2017/4/13," When you think you've had good soup dumplings back home and you sit down without any expectations, your first bite will fill you with more than just soup. It'll fill you with the flavors and techniques of all of the chefs behind the counter and make you wonder how they turned something that we've seen countless times before and elevate it to a level where no one has taken the dish. Not only are the soup dumplings a must try - all the dishes deserve attention. From the taro dumplings which are made from fresh taro to the spicy dishes made from their own hot sauce creation, there is nothing better than getting all of your expectations blown out of the water and have a single establishment redefine excellence in its field. Stay for the food and leave with the regret that you don't live next to the restaurant.

The pork xlb were perfect, steaming hot, encased in a thin tender skin with enough substance to be picked-up and placed with chopsticks. The pork and shrimp dumplings were equally stellar, and the filling in both were perfectly cooked, yielding a unctuous mix of meat, shrimp and soup. Other dishes were great and well-executed too, from the cold cucumber and kao fu appetizers to the noodles (the spicy noodles, the noodles with preserved mustard greens and pork, and the beef/tendon noodles). The noodles in all forms were cooked well, meaning that they were soft but had a little bite or bounce (e.g. semi al dente).  We ate more than we should have, but thankfully worked it off as did the 40min walk back to the hotel.\",,,,,,,2017/3/27," If have to choose just one restaurant to eat before you leave Taipei, this is the one you never regret!

Not too bad.\",,,,,,,2017/3/29," factory of expert chefs that only do 1 task, making food at lightening speeds as if they were factory workers on a conveyor belt! the food is top notch.however...it is super expensive....we're talking about 2000NT for 2 people.\",,,,,,,2017/3/29," Five stars for everything - food, service, personnel, attitude, taste, serving speed! Great experience!\",,,,,,,2017/3/28," I had eaten here a few times before I learned it has a fairly extensive chain that spreads world wide. You wouldn't know it though, because everything from the service to the delectable dishes seem too good to be able to chain without losing the excellence. No worries. If you want the best of Taiwanese dumplings this is it. There may be better soups and noodle dishes to be found, if you search for them, but you can't go wrong with any of the dumpling varieties. Yes, getting in takes patience as there are no reservations, but it's worth the wait. If you've been to Taiwan but not Din Tai Fung, you should get that done and check it off of your ""must visit"" list. \",,,,,,,2017/3/28, Although it was busy. The wait was only about 10 minutes for 2 people. This was during lunch. They have a great waiting setup with numbers which is great for non Asians. Price is moderate and service was super quick. This is a busy place but they are fast and efficient \,,,,,,,2017/3/28," First ate Din Tai Fung in 2010 so was happy to learn of this newer branch. It was in the fabulous Taipei 101 building and worth the 60 minute wait. The 5 of us had the delicious dumplings, fried rice, chicken soup and a sweet dumpling. Service was attentive and even my purse was covered by a cloth for privacy and safety.\",,,,,,,2017/3/28," Lunch with overseas visitors at Din Tai Fung 101 branch last week. It was crowded with so many people, after got the number ticket, I realized that most of the people waiting were from tour groups, therefore, once the group entered the shop, the situation didn't look so bad. Was able to get a table after 25min. By the time we got in, our order came very quickly. Food was very yummy as usual, good service there and staff were nice. Highly recommend this place if you like dumplings, noodles.\",,,,,,,2017/3/27," Coming off of a slightly sub-par visit to the Fuxing branch the day before, the Taipei 101 location re-aligned our faith, and all is well again. The pork xlb were perfect, steaming hot, encased in a thin tender skin with enough substance to be picked-up and placed with chopsticks. The pork and shrimp dumplings were equally stellar, and the filling in both were perfectly cooked, yielding a unctuous mix of meat, shrimp and soup. Other dishes were great and well-executed too, from the cold cucumber and kao fu appetizers to the noodles (the spicy noodles, the noodles with preserved mustard greens and pork, and the beef/tendon noodles). The noodles in all forms were cooked well, meaning that they were soft but had a little bite or bounce (e.g. semi al dente).  We ate more than we should have, but thankfully worked it off as did the 40min walk back to the hotel.\",,,,,,,2017/3/27," If have to choose just one restaurant to eat before you leave Taipei, this is the one you never regret!

The Taipei 101 restaurant was my 7th Din Tai Fung.When you arrive, check in with the desk, and get queued for a seat, and pick up a menu and an order form. I was traveling alone on business, soI was a party of 1. The wait for a seat was advertised at 25 minutes, but I was seated in under 15 minutes. I ordered the pork xiao long bao, stirred pea sprouts, and a noodle dish. The Xiao Long Bao (XLB) are a Shanghai style dumpling, they are my reason for visiting visiting a Din Tai Fung. They were good as usual. They provide a multi-language instruction card for how to eat the XLB. The noodles were very good. The Pea Sprouts were fresh and garlic-y. Price for the meal with a large beer was US$18.30They also sell various souvenir box sets that are suitable for gifts. On the way out of the restaurant don't forget to look up and see Taipei 101 looming up into the sky.\",,,,,,,2017/3/13," My first visit to Taipei has been truly unforgettable, thanks to this place which in my opinion has managed to bring the ultimate foodie experience to the next level! The xiao long bao is definitely exquisite and the other dishes in their menu are simply yummy! Although we waited for about half an hour before we got a seat, I would say that it's all worth the trip.

Be sure to take a look at the order chit while waiting because you'd be darn hungry once you enter.Upon entering the restaurant, you'd be able to see the dumpling making process. Just like most Din Tai Fungs, the restaurant has a clear glass window showcasing their employees making the dim sums.'Shao mai/Xiu mai' was my favourite here. Forget about the ones you see in cheap restaurants and frozen packagings because the ones served here look nothing like that.

OK, the ticket printed 5 to 10 minutes wait time. Well, pretty close and the crowd just got bigger & bigger at around 11","30 am (open around 11 am). We ordered the usual dumpling soup and beef noodle and appetizer. So far So Good. Just a little overpriced, but hey is tourist attraction and not many in the United States can try such a handcrafted freshly made dumpling.\",,,,,,2017/3/1," This was not my first time with Din Tai Fung, but they have never disappointed me. I have tried in Shanghai, Bangkok and Macau before, the taste was of course similar. However, having the original was worth reviewing about. My favourite dishes are the original pork-stuffed XLB, taro bun, and hot and sour soup. When in Taipei, it a must to try! \",,,,,,,2017/3/1," Amazing place. We had a wonderful lunch here our 2nd day in Taipei, and ended up eating two more times during our trip at their other Taipei locations too. Wonderful dumplings of course but the people are amazing, the most kind, friendly, hosts, waiters, cashiers, Everyone!!! This is a well run place and it appears everyone really is having fun yet the service is perfect, the food is served quickly and perfectly. Popular for a very-good reason.\",,,,,,,2017/2/27," Went there for the xiao long bao, had to taste the original, and it didn't disappoint. The soup inside the dumpling has a suave taste that I didn't find in others. We didn't wait long but I saw a long queue for those who were in bigger groups. There is a take out counter, and you can order from there, and eat your goodies at the food court which is right beside the resto. Its at the basement of Taipei 101, and very near the elevators going to the 5th floor where you can get tickets to go to the 101 observatory. There is also an entrance to the train station right outside the resto. We also tried the hot and sour soup, and it was very good. Not overly spicy and sour, and went very good with the xiao long bao. I saw lots of people enjoying their crab fried rice and dimsum. Will get that next time. Highly recommended according to those who got them.\",,,,,,,2017/2/24," Din Tai Fung is situated at B1 of the Taipei 101 Mall. The first time we went by, there was a long queue outside the restaurant. We thought there is no chance we get to eat here. We were a party of 12 people. But on our last day in Taipei, we went to the restaurant about 16","30. It was a Wednesday and there wasn't any queue. We were seated right away. The waiters were very friendly and took our orders quickly. We ordered ordinary Xiao long, crabmeat Xiao long and Xiao long with truffle taste. I must say I enjoyed ordinary and crabmeat Xiao long best. The truffle was not the best combination after my taste.We also ordered other dishes from the menu. The kids loved the fried rice with pork. The ""Peking soup"" was a bit tasteless. When we finished our meal, there was again a long queue outside the restaurant. So tips is to come early. Overall we had a great dining experience. Will come back again. \",,,,,,2017/2/23," I came around 4 pm for late lunch and was happy to wait only 10 min, as I was told that the waiting line is usually longer, around 1-2 hrs sometimes. The hostess are very friendly and effective. You have to register at one counter where you will be given a menu, there will be another person to help you to choose the menu items. The place is very clean and super busy. There are lots of cooks in the back of kitchen and are working like bees. The hostesses and the waitress are walking up and down, someone brings the dishes, someone is cleaning the tables, and someone is constantly refilling your green tea cup. The whole process is very effective. They serve lots of pork, if you don't eat that, it can be more challenging to choose your food. But I did enjoy it!\",,,,,,,2017/2/23," This place gets very busy with an indicator outside of your waiting time, but if you time it right, you might just be able to be escorted to your table immediately (like us on our second visit)The dim sum are all prepared fresh by a large group of chefs and are delicious. There are other branches as well, but we only visited this one and highly recommend it.Friendly service and even though it is always busy, it is not too noisy. Great value for money for dim sum of this quality.\",,,,,,,2017/2/23, I had the world famous Xiao Long Bao and the hot and sour soup. It was every bit as good as I was led to believe based on the reviews and the hype surrounding this restaurant. The wait was only about 10 mins to get a table and the service was very efficient. All servers were well versed in English. \,,,,,,,2017/2/23, The service here is good.The food here is very good and has more variety than Singapore.Recommended to try when in Taipei. This branch is the nearest if you are staying at Grand Hyatt Taipei.\,,,,,,,2017/2/23," As a solo traveler who does not enjoy waiting in long lines, I opted for the much faster option of ordering take out (10 min wait versus 90+ minute wait) and ate them in the adjacent food court. The price was fair for a Michelin starred restaurant (about $8 for a half serve of soup dumplings and a half serve of regular steamed dumplings). Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high as I felt that I have eaten much tastier dumplings both at home in Australia and abroad in Asia but it was enjoyable nonetheless. Service was great.\",,,,,,,2017/3/1," After visiting the \'a5\'78\'a5\'5f101 Taipei 101, we decided to join the fun and get in line for the numbering system. OK, the ticket printed 5 to 10 minutes wait time. Well, pretty close and the crowd just got bigger & bigger at around 11","30 am (open around 11 am). We ordered the usual dumpling soup and beef noodle and appetizer. So far So Good. Just a little overpriced, but hey is tourist attraction and not many in the United States can try such a handcrafted freshly made dumpling.\",,,,,,2017/3/1," This was not my first time with Din Tai Fung, but they have never disappointed me. I have tried in Shanghai, Bangkok and Macau before, the taste was of course similar. However, having the original was worth reviewing about. My favourite dishes are the original pork-stuffed XLB, taro bun, and hot and sour soup. When in Taipei, it a must to try! \",,,,,,,2017/3/1," Amazing place. We had a wonderful lunch here our 2nd day in Taipei, and ended up eating two more times during our trip at their other Taipei locations too. Wonderful dumplings of course but the people are amazing, the most kind, friendly, hosts, waiters, cashiers, Everyone!!! This is a well run place and it appears everyone really is having fun yet the service is perfect, the food is served quickly and perfectly. Popular for a very-good reason.\",,,,,,,2017/2/27," Went there for the xiao long bao, had to taste the original, and it didn't disappoint. The soup inside the dumpling has a suave taste that I didn't find in others. We didn't wait long but I saw a long queue for those who were in bigger groups. There is a take out counter, and you can order from there, and eat your goodies at the food court which is right beside the resto. Its at the basement of Taipei 101, and very near the elevators going to the 5th floor where you can get tickets to go to the 101 observatory. There is also an entrance to the train station right outside the resto. We also tried the hot and sour soup, and it was very good. Not overly spicy and sour, and went very good with the xiao long bao. I saw lots of people enjoying their crab fried rice and dimsum. Will get that next time. Highly recommended according to those who got them.\",,,,,,,2017/2/24," Din Tai Fung is situated at B1 of the Taipei 101 Mall. The first time we went by, there was a long queue outside the restaurant. We thought there is no chance we get to eat here. We were a party of 12 people. But on our last day in Taipei, we went to the restaurant about 16","30. It was a Wednesday and there wasn't any queue. We were seated right away. The waiters were very friendly and took our orders quickly. We ordered ordinary Xiao long, crabmeat Xiao long and Xiao long with truffle taste. I must say I enjoyed ordinary and crabmeat Xiao long best. The truffle was not the best combination after my taste.We also ordered other dishes from the menu. The kids loved the fried rice with pork. The ""Peking soup"" was a bit tasteless. When we finished our meal, there was again a long queue outside the restaurant. So tips is to come early. Overall we had a great dining experience. Will come back again. \",,,,,,2017/2/23," I came around 4 pm for late lunch and was happy to wait only 10 min, as I was told that the waiting line is usually longer, around 1-2 hrs sometimes. The hostess are very friendly and effective. You have to register at one counter where you will be given a menu, there will be another person to help you to choose the menu items. The place is very clean and super busy. There are lots of cooks in the back of kitchen and are working like bees. The hostesses and the waitress are walking up and down, someone brings the dishes, someone is cleaning the tables, and someone is constantly refilling your green tea cup. The whole process is very effective. They serve lots of pork, if you don't eat that, it can be more challenging to choose your food. But I did enjoy it!\",,,,,,,2017/2/23," This place gets very busy with an indicator outside of your waiting time, but if you time it right, you might just be able to be escorted to your table immediately (like us on our second visit)The dim sum are all prepared fresh by a large group of chefs and are delicious. There are other branches as well, but we only visited this one and highly recommend it.Friendly service and even though it is always busy, it is not too noisy.

Food was dis-appointing, bland hot and sour soup and no salt on the table for me to add. Drunken chicken tasted like drinking the wine out of the bottle and again needed salt and may be some other spice? Their famous dumpling was warm (should be piping hot) and tasteless inside and the outside was semi-hard on the top. Upon further investigation, those dumplings were made by students. Yes, we all need to learn but there should be some QC somewhere at that price level. No repeats and never again.\",,,,,,2017/2/21, Got the highly recommended dumplings and some other food. Service was very good and food was fresh but my dumplings weren't very juicy.Arrived at 11,"15 on a Sunday and although there were about 50 people in front of me, we were seated within 15 minutes. You write down your order while you're waiting which helps speed up service. Restaurant opens at 11am Sunday so recommend getting there when they open.\",,,,,,2017/2/20," Love this chain of good quality dim sum. The food is utterly stunning, every time we have visited. Not surprising it is always busy. Go at an unusual time to avoid long queues. Highly recommended. \",,,,,,,2017/2/18," What can be said that hasn't been said? Just go here, and the one must-order (there are many great things on the menu) are the Xialongbaos (XLBs). Had the pork, chicken, shrimp XLBs and were all fantastic. The 101 Branch is at the bottom of the Taipei 101 tower, so if you are short on # of days as we were, this is a good way to combine multiple Taipei essentials in a close location. For uniqueness sake, there are 4 specific points I'll add about our Din Tai Fung experience",1. The WAIT PROCESS," There's a wait counter (in minutes) above the check-in desk. Bottom line is that it's worth it no matter what, if long then put a name in and do something in 101 in the meantime until your number is called (also shown on a screen). However, this place is so efficient that the line always moved faster than advertised. We went twice, the first time listed as 80 minutes during peak dinner time on a holiday but number was called 60 (we entertained ourselves easily in the meantime). The second time wait was 15 minutes, number called in 7 minutes. You can also go watch the dumpling masters whip out dumplings from scratch, which is a marvel itself.2. The SERVICE"," simply excellent. The waitresses are super friendly, highly attentive throughout the meal (bringing and taking food as well as tea fills). Many are willing to teach about the food, recommended ratio of dipping sauces (3","1 rice wine vinegar to soy sauce, with ginger shavings mixed!), and history. They complete the experience and drive the efficiency.3. The hot & sour soup"," while tasty, if you are a hot & sour soup addict like us, it may disappoint if you're looking for a particular hot/spicy version. Like everything else we had here, it was tasty, however the only thing that underperformed considering how amazing everything else was (although if you aren't a fan of spicy foods you may like this version more). They will bring pepper mix to tableside, though.4. Takes Amex (by no means a dealbreaker, but scores extra points here).(5. Bonus)", get a dessert red bean or taro bun! Great way to cap off the meal.\,2017/2/17," As at any DTF on the globe, from Taipei to Bangkok and Los Angeles, expect to line up for at least 30 minutes! The dumplings are fresh and tasty as always, this time we ordered Xiao Long Bao with truffels for a change. What a delicacy!You can expect constant quality with all DTF globally (so far).\",,,,,,,2017/2/15, Never failed to go Ding Tai Fungi whenever we go Taipei. Their food is totally perfect and the staffs are very helpful. Must go early to avoid waiting for more than half an hours. Value for money \,,,,,,,2017/2/14, I ate twice at the Din Tai Fung (101) which is located inside a posh shopping centre. These were the best dumplings I have ever eaten by a mile (sorry Yauatcha London). The place is actually a true fast food experience. I had and ate my dim sums in 20-30 mins. As the place is very popular (has at least two other locations in Taipei too) be prepared to wait. At the first time I had to wait only about 15 minutes and for the second visit bout 40 minutes. But they have a very informative queuing system. The specialty there is XiaoLongBao - all of them are excellent but you must try truffle and pork one - it is AMAZING. With 25-30 euros you will have plenty of dumplings plus drinks. Go also and see how the chefs prepare the dumplings. Given how hectic the place is service is also surprisingly attentive and effective. THIS PLACE IS NOT TO BE MISSED WHEN IN TAIPEI\,,,,,,,2017/2/13," Very good food, especially damplings and noodle soups.Very kind and efficient service, all people English speaking, the best for foreigners living in Taipei.It's a must every time I go to Taipei!\",,,,,,,2017/2/6," I'm from London, but I have been living in Taipei for a few years now. Therefore, I have been to Din Tai Fang plenty of times. Whenever a friend, or a friend of a friend comes to visit Taiwan for the first time, Din Tai Fang is a place we always go to. Their food is consistently good. Their fried rice, wonton noodle soup, pot stickers (guo tie), spicy dumplings and vegetable dishes are very good. In particular, their cabbage (gao li cai) dish is amazing (although many restaurants in Taiwan make this dish too). I am picky when eating certain dishes, and I feel that Din Tai Fang's prawn/pork dumplings (xiao mai) and pork dumplings (xiaolongbao) are not that great. I've had better in other places throughout Asia. With that said, you should still try these dishes. I would also recommend that you can go anytime, either lunch or dinner is great.Coming from Europe, I would say that Europeans would love Din Tai Fang, so if you can handle waiting in a long queue you should try it. You get a ticket and wait for your number to be called out. The system is very efficient, because it tells you roughly how long you have to wait for a table. The average wait is usually an hour, so you should plan to get a ticket about an hour before you plan eating. Once you have a ticket you can go shopping or explore the local area. You don't have to wait directly in the queue. There are also many branches too, but the original is in Daan district, by Dongmen MRT station.Lastly, I would like to say that the customer service is excellent, and the staff will fill your cup with tea whenever it is less than a full cup. The value for money is excellent too. It is cheap when comparing with European restaurant prices, but it is expensive by Taiwanese standards. Some Taiwanese people feel it is overpriced.\",,,,,,,2017/2/5, The queue to get a seat here will take you 1 hour to 1.5 hours.

All were very delicious.The price of the meal was quite reasonable. Often, you have to make a reservationfor a seat. Electric bulletin board displays the approximate waiting time.\",,,,,,,2017/1/17," This was my first food stop. I was lucky. I arrived and I had a table. Be prepared to wait for one to two hours. So plan your day, rock up to get your name down and go and shop while you wait. Words cannot describe both the food and the service. It is definitely worth the wait. It is not cheap by Asian food standard but it is definitely worth every penny.\",,,,,,,2017/1/16," We had already visited Din Tai Fung's Zhongshan location on a prior day, but when we strolled by the 101 branch we did not resist and went back. As much as we like to explore new food, we kept coming back, it's that good.The menu classifies the dishes -- particularly their signature dumplings -- into different categories, includes a picture, and whether they might offend dietary restrictions (spicy, peanuts, etc.). Jasmin tea is served non-stop and a perfect accompaniment to their food.In typical Taiwanese fashion, service is lightning fast and efficient. Most locations will have people outside waiting to be seated. But the line moves fast and most of the time you are seated without delay. While you wait, you can preselect your dishes and write them down in a form given to you. Even though most servers speak English to some degree, communication can be difficult, so it\'a1\'a6s better to make you your mind on your own.After a lunch will all kinds of dumplings, we preferred to have dessert at another place in the 101 mall, which offers plenty of choices.Prices are very reasonable for the quality food they serve.\",,,,,,,2017/1/16," I just love Din Tai Fung food.

The only trouble is when you appear there without a booking as it is usually full-house and better to make prior appointments.\",,,,,,,2017/1/24," nice visit & good service, delicious food, absolutely non halal!! this cheaper from din tai fung singapore its cheaper 5 times at xiao lung bao yeah... very lucky with no queu, i came at 9",15 PM at tuesday ...\,,,,,,2017/1/23," Well, I expected a long queue and it was pretty long, but thankfully to its electronic reservation, we were accommodated after 30 minutes of waiting!

Can be much worse apparently but that for me reflects the quality of the food. Really is worth the wait - best dumplings I've eaten. Really recommended\,,,,,,,2017/1/18," Din Tai Fung is a restaurant originating in Taiwan, specializing in xiaolongbao (steamed dumplings). We ordered seven Chinese foods. All were very delicious.The price of the meal was quite reasonable. Often, you have to make a reservationfor a seat. Electric bulletin board displays the approximate waiting time.\",,,,,,,2017/1/17," This was my first food stop. I was lucky. I arrived and I had a table. Be prepared to wait for one to two hours. So plan your day, rock up to get your name down and go and shop while you wait. Words cannot describe both the food and the service. It is definitely worth the wait. It is not cheap by Asian food standard but it is definitely worth every penny.\",,,,,,,2017/1/16," We had already visited Din Tai Fung's Zhongshan location on a prior day, but when we strolled by the 101 branch we did not resist and went back. As much as we like to explore new food, we kept coming back, it's that good.The menu classifies the dishes -- particularly their signature dumplings -- into different categories, includes a picture, and whether they might offend dietary restrictions (spicy, peanuts, etc.). Jasmin tea is served non-stop and a perfect accompaniment to their food.In typical Taiwanese fashion, service is lightning fast and efficient. Most locations will have people outside waiting to be seated. But the line moves fast and most of the time you are seated without delay. While you wait, you can preselect your dishes and write them down in a form given to you. Even though most servers speak English to some degree, communication can be difficult, so it\'a1\'a6s better to make you your mind on your own.After a lunch will all kinds of dumplings, we preferred to have dessert at another place in the 101 mall, which offers plenty of choices.Prices are very reasonable for the quality food they serve.\",,,,,,,2017/1/16," I just love Din Tai Fung food. It's always fresh and delicious.The quality never disappointed me. All things are even suitable for western stomach.I brought there some colleague of mine, which don't have much access to Chinese food and they loved all the dishes we had.The staff is very friendly and attentive.The waiting line might be long in the first place, but the service is quite fast.\",,,,,,,2017/1/15," Incredible, efficient service balanced by perfectly made soup and savoury dumplings.

W were given a number and the number being served was flashed at the entrance. We were willing to wait because my 2 girls didn't want to leave Taipei without tasting the authentic Xiao Long Bao.

Go during peak lunchtime and dinner and be prepared to wait. However they have a great system in place for taking your name and position in the queue. As I said in my title, I would go back to Taipei just to eat at Din Tai Fung. I challenge anyone to direct me to a place that has better Xialongbao (Shanghai Soup Dumplings). Service is always good and very reasonably priced. Although I wouldn't place Din Tai Fung in the cheap eats category, it is by no means expensive.\",,,,,,,2016/12/26," Apparently, they have branches everywhere now. Here at 101, at SOGO, etc. similar menu as the US, all of a standard quality consistent across all heir stores. This is a big one but also has very long lines since so many people visit 101. Not too far west is SOGO dintai fung with no or little line.\",,,,,,,2016/12/26," Don't miss this restaurants! Friendly service, great food and a memorable experience. We all ordered differently and shared most of the dishes. \",,,,,,,2016/12/21, Very happy to have dined there. Restaurant is clean and food as expected. Next time will bring family along as well.\,,,,,,,2016/12/21," After viewing Taipei 101 we went to refuel at Din Tai Fung. We waited a short time, about 15minutes and used the time to select our meal.We ordered about 7 dishes (which was overkill for 2 people) including fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, xiaolongbao, veggies & noodles & wontons. The favourite dish was the crispy dumplings and the spicy sauce wontons.The only thing which could have improved the dining for me would have been to have fried chili sauce (like the hawker centre or HK dumpling fried chili sauce).\",,,,,,,2016/12/20," great food with fantastic service, no problem with English / Japanese service, one of the top choice to bring overseas friend over here\",,,,,,,2016/12/20," I have visited quite several of the same brand including Hong Kong, but the taste of this one is second to none.

Overall quite good and tasty food.\,,,,,,,2016/12/20," Visited Din Tai Fung at Taipei 101 twice, and ordered xiao long baos on both occasions. Taste and quality were excellent, on par with the Singapore version. Had they served freshly cut chilies instead of chili sauce, it would have been perfect! Also enjoyed the hot spicy sour soup, pork wonton soup and various stir fried green vegetables. Waiting time is not too long after 2pm!\",,,,,,,2016/12/20, Good food and service. Fresh dumpling. The noodle is not that great. The price is reasonable. Good location\,,,,,,,2016/12/19, We focused on the dumplings but the other dishes we tried were equally tasty. Dumplings are certainly fresh as you can watch them being made and steamed. Highly recommended but expect a wait as this is a very popular restaurant. \,,,,,,,2016/12/18," Although we already have a branch in our country of Din Tai Fung, trying out their food in their motherland is a must. Though Taipei is also known for their foods in their night market, trying out one of their famous restaurants is recommended.The quality of service is fantastic, and the food is as fantastic as well. It's worth the visit and won't even put a dent on your budget.\",,,,,,,2016/12/18," Every now and then i have to come back to Din Tai Fung to satisfy my cravings for xiaolongbao, the famous soup-dumplings.\",,,,,,,2016/12/16," Obviously, it was delicious and obviously it was overpriced. Is it worth it? Yeah, I think so just so you can say you went to DTF in Taiwan. I feel that the quality is the same as the one back home in Los Angeles, more specifically, the Arcadia location. I thought it would taste way better but it didn't to me so either my taste buds suck or there really isn't a difference. I really enjoyed watching the staff make the dumplings in the back. Photos are welcomed!There's also pictures of Tom Cruise when he visited DTF framed by the dumpling making areas.

So one can take a number with the estimated wait time (can be as long as more than 45 minutes at busy times) and go shopping, and comeback about 10 minutes before the promised wait time, just in case the wait becomes shorter.

The restaurant is very modern, clean and spacious, the atmosphere electric and the service exemplary.

So we were very happy to find out that there was no waiting at all, the Lady's at the front desk are always very nice and showed us to a nice table.We ordered a noodle soup, sesame souce noodles and pork xiaolongbao. I was very surprised that the soup was almost flavorless and the noodles slightly overcooked. The xiaolongbao were served while we were eating the noodles, which was far to early, normaly they would wait till they bring out the xiaolongbao, we had to stop eating our noodles so the xiaolongbao wouldn't get too cold. At this stage I noticed that they already weren't hot anymore, meaning they were standing for a while, which ended with a soggy bottom... the flavor was very poor too, nothing you would expect from the famous chain. Very disappointing.They say, you will know the quality of the food when you visit the toilet...which ended badly for us, which say's alot for the quality of the food.Overall it was a very bad experiance for us and we will not come again to the 101 branch.Altho I highly recomend the Fuxing Branch! The lines are shorter and the food is better!\",,,,,,,2016/12/6," Arrived at DTF 101 branch 30 minutes before opening. The staff handed us the food list for us to check our orders. We ordered dumpling and XLB. We were seated near the glass kitchen where several males where making dumplings. It was fun to watch how dumplings are being made. The XLB was delicious. The soup inside was tasty. Dip in little vinegar and soy sauce and put a little shredded ginger and they're excellent.We have visited branches in Singapore, Philippines, and now Taiwan. These dumplings are really excellent and the service fast.\",,,,,,,2016/12/6," We went to Din Tai Fung 3 times during our HK + Taipei trip. I like this branch a little more than the Xinyi branch, though maybe it's because we didn't have to wait too long for our reservation. We came on a weekday around 5pm whereas for the Xinyi branch, we went on a Sunday during peak lunch. I really like their reservation numbering system, it's universal and works for all sorts of group sizes.Always very impressed by the DTF staff, they are always on the ball with our service requests. I love that they use coat covers and have a little hamper for your purses/backpacks so it's not in the way of other tables.The food menu is pretty standard across all DTF chains, except the Taipei ones have extra appetizers. We enjoyed the Kao Fu, and the marinated chicken was alright.The standard pork soup dumplings, as well as the crab soup dumplings are always delicious. We tried the truffle soup dumplings at one point, but they were nothing spectacular. We also love getting the pork chop fried rice here, and of course a Chinese vegetable dish.Best of all, the prices are quite reasonable especially for the service you are getting.\",,,,,,,2016/12/5, This is a great restaurant that is famous throughout the world.

We waited about 15 minutes to get in but worth every minute. You order while in line and when seated your food starts to magically appear by an army of lovely waitresses.

Friendly staff and amazing quality food.\",,,,,,,2016/12/4," The prices comparatively are very high but michelin star rating and exceptionally hot and delicious pork dumplings worth for it. The ginger and soya sauce goes very good with all dumplings and it is very crowded restaurant because of one of the favorite restaurant of Taiwanese in iconic Taipei 101 building, one might need to wait for couple of min. or an hour. \",,,,,,,2016/12/3," When in Taiwan, i would be remiss to not at least give Ding Tai Fung a try. After all, this restaurant is now pretty globalized and widely accepted by many countries. The question is whether the actual restaurant in Taiwan would taste the same or better then the franchises elsewhere in the world?This Taipei 101 outlet is the most frequently visited outlet by tourists because its located centrally and next to one of their more interesting architectural attractions. The Taipei 101 tower is a tall obelisk towering over the city and was once the tallest building in the world. What is extremely interesting about it is how this building can even exist in earthquake prone Taiwan. You'll need to visit and check it out yourself or i can write about it in future posts if you prefer.Majority of the outlet feels pretty much the same as the outlets in Singapore. The decor, the open kitchen and the staff uniforms are quite similar. Coming here almost made me question if i'd left Singapore at all until the service convinced me i was in another country. Service in Taiwan has always impressed me and thats not to say the outlets in Singapore have bad service, its just that service in Taiwan just feels like they have more heart. I won't be going into all the details about each dish but put simply, the quality is on par or slightly better then Singapore. The meat tastes sweeter for the xiao long bao (not shown here), the rice is more evenly coated and the noodles tasted more springy. It might be the ""holiday effect"" where everything tastes, looks and feels better but at the very least, i can say Singapore's version is pretty spot on when compared.The difference is that the Taiwan outlet is cheaper then Singapore and that also played a part in making everything better. Same quality food for cheaper, how can it be worse? Verdict"," If you're traveling to Taiwan and from Singapore, you can give this a miss because what you get back home is pretty close.

The steaming process tends to puncture such thin walls (even if they can be formed in the first place\'a1\'58a non-trivial achievement in and of itself), after which the bao is consider ruined (since it then no longer holds the liquid, which is integral to the enjoyment of the whole). Therefore, Din Tai Fung's ability to mass produce such a superb delicacy is simply phenomenal.

We insisted we didn't mind the cheaper as we like the real 'native' experience but we figured if the nationals want to go here it must be good. There was supposed to be a wait of 50mins (! Yeah, that put us off too...why wait for the more expensive place for that long) but in the end we waited maybe for 15! They show the waiting time by the entrance so you grab a ticket at the counter and wait your turn. I assume they prefer to estimate higher rather than lower! Finally, it was so worth the short wait! We were greeted at the table with a warm tea awaiting us and were seen to immediately. The food came quickly and was absolutely delicious with a wide variety of choice at very low cost (slightly more expensive maybe for local standards but for a westerner still extremely cheap). Exciting is that you can go and watch the cooks in the kitchen making the dumplings, which are a speciality, as they have an open view kitchen.

The service was also the best we have experienced by far, among other DTF branches visited in the region. Even if we had to wait for a table to be available, they occupied our minds with pre-ordering our food; they also had a very efficient and effective waiting system.

They show the waiting time by the entrance so you grab a ticket at the counter and wait your turn. I assume they prefer to estimate higher rather than lower! Finally, it was so worth the short wait! We were greeted at the table with a warm tea awaiting us and were seen to immediately. The food came quickly and was absolutely delicious with a wide variety of choice at very low cost (slightly more expensive maybe for local standards but for a westerner still extremely cheap). Exciting is that you can go and watch the cooks in the kitchen making the dumplings, which are a speciality, as they have an open view kitchen. All in all a wonderful experience I would recommend to anyone in Taipei!\",,,,,,,2016/11/8," We expected good food and as usual for Din Tai Fung it didn't disappoint. However, we arrived 1hr before closing and many of the items on the menu were no longer available\",,,,,,,2016/11/8," Among the tourist spots we visited in Taipei was Taipei 101. We also wanted to complete our tourist experience by eating at Din Tai Fung. Without a doubt, the food in the Din Tai Fung branch (Taipei 101) we visited was excellent and, oddly, the most delicious among other branches. The service was also the best we have experienced by far, among other DTF branches visited in the region. Even if we had to wait for a table to be available, they occupied our minds with pre-ordering our food; they also had a very efficient and effective waiting system. Definitely going back there again!My only suggestion is to have something special for guests to get entertained with or to have a free appetizer (or dessert) to maximize utility and satisfaction of service.\",,,,,,,2016/11/7," I had a great time, it has an awesome location. Amazing food, but beware if you're in a tight budget! I would definitely go back! \",,,,,,,2016/11/7," We waited about an hour for a table on a Monday night, the place was packed. The food was excellent as usual, very fresh and tasty. We tried every type of xiaolongbao an dumplings. Also recommend the spicy wontons and pot stickers. It's always worth the wait to eat here\",,,,,,,2016/11/7," Had dinner at Ding Tai Fung on a weekday. There was no queue, which was great. The staffs were polite and attentive. Ordered 3 dishes and they came 1 at a time, taking about 10 to 15 mins from the time we placed our orders. The portions for the 3 dishes were just nice for 2 adults. The spicy seafood dumplings, prawn fried rice and dragon tail vegetable were very good. Overall it was a pleasant experience to be dining at the famous Ding Tai Fung which has branches all over the world. \",,,,,,,2016/11/6," You gotta wait your turn to get in. Customers are given a queue number, and it required a 20min wait for us. But when we got in, food was served quick and piping hot which was good. Wait staff were professional and courteous. Food was good. Xiaolongbaos are a must have item when you are here. Food was reasonably priced. \",,,,,,,2016/11/6, Definitely not as good as original shop.

This branch had a lot of waiting customers in queue (some from group tours)!Do try the xiao long bao and dumplings!!!\",,,,,,,2016/11/4," We had to wait 55 minutes for a table but it was worth it. It was a Zoo in the waiting area. We walked around the shops to kill the time. The Taipei 101 is a huge luxurious building full of high end brands. The location is on the ground floor of Taipei 101 and is a modern clean restaurant. The food was very good, hot and fresh and service was prompt. Highly recommended if you love dumplings and Chinese dishes. \",,,,,,,2016/11/4," Visited this outlet for the first time in the month of september, food was excellent as usual, flavors a bit different from the Singapore outlets but great food and great flavor.

All was good.\",,,,,,,2016/10/31," Every time I'm in Taiwan, DTF is at the top of my list of places to go. This is my favorite xiao long bao restaurant in the world!

The system they set up is effective thus reduce a lot of waiting time. Food are serve hot and just right. Should pay a visit if you are in Taipei.\,,,,,,,2016/10/29, Short version," The food here is delicious and the service is impeccable. We came in with a stroller, and they tagged it for us so we could pick it up. They provided little rolling containers to put all of our bags so they wouldn't be on the floor or take up precious space. They provided plastic utensils and dishes with cute designs for our two kids. So we were already pumped before the food came out. And it was amazing. Highly recommend the xiao long bao. If that's all you get, I won't blame you. BUT MAKE SURE YOU EAT IT PROPERLY. Very gently, pick up the dumpling and put it on the soup spoon. DO NOT break the skin. Then you can either put the whole thing in your mouth (would not recommend; it's very hot) OR you can make a little hole and then drink the soup that's inside the dumpling. That broth is DIVINE. Drink the soup, then eat the dumpling. There's also a glass area where you can see the cooks making more dumplings and steaming them. It's a fun distraction for the kids for a few minutes. \",,,,,,2016/10/29," Amazing restaurant, free oolong tea and they refill it many times. Interesting to see how dumplings are made.

The reputation of the place is based on its dumplings, that are very reminiscent of Shanghai style. They are very good indeed. We tired some 12 different varieties of dumplings, and all were between very good and excellent. My only complaints (besides the usual noise that is typical) are that 1) they did not have any selection of teas, and the one that they served was mediocre, and 2) they did not have red chilly sauce which to my taste add a zest to the dumplings.

The \'a4\'70\'b5\'e6is served promptly. You can taste the difference in the ingredients used here as compared to Singapore, the bean sprouts used has a larger head, fresh and crunchy. The small portion of \'a4\'70\uc0\u40857 \'a5\'5dis served piping hot and seemingly, the skin of the dumplings are thinner than the one in Singapore.

However, it is best to head there before 6. We went there at 5pm so we were able to get a seat rather quickly. But when we left the place at 6pm, the waiting time for a seat was worth 50 mins long.

Definitely did not disappoint with both the service and the quality of food being served there. The ambience was also a plus as it felt like such a great place to be in (by feeling the vibes around). However, it is best to head there before 6. We went there at 5pm so we were able to get a seat rather quickly. But when we left the place at 6pm, the waiting time for a seat was worth 50 mins long. The early bird catches the worms. So if you want to truly enjoy the dimsum without the constraints of people pressuring for seats, head there early! PS"," Food was great, 10/10.

As a signature restaurant chain in Taipei, HK and China, the service in this branch is the best. Staffs are polite, efficient and helpful. Food is excellent and you need to try to Beef Soup in addition to the famous dumpling. The beef is so tender and you will never forget it. For the dumplings, I order the crab egg and the traditional but each in 5 pieces. Do not order the 10 pieces one except you have at least 4 persons otherwise you can only taste one style. If you like the Chinese tea, it is good because it is free and staff will refill your cup periodically with a smile and you do not need to order the soft drinks. This will save certain amount in your bill. Just two cents from a Hongkee.

It would have been worth it even if the wait was longer. We ordered pork Xiaolongbao (like a dumpling), pork and veggie dumplings, and braised beef stew (all meat no tendons). The beef was AMAZING. Super marbeled and incredibly soft. My bf and I both got the soup, and the 2 dumpling trays, and total came out to ~$21.

The original location is the best Din Tai Fung. The prices were reasonable enough for us to order at least one item from each section. The dumplings are amazing.

I found out that it's better to order take-aways since the service fee is free of charge, and it really reduce much money.

Yes, Din Tai Fung ","-) and I do agree that no matter where they open their outlets in the rest of the world, Din Tai Fung in Taipei is still the best.

The wait of 20 minutes was worth it though. You can watch the chefs making dumplings so incredibly quickly. The dumplings themselves are delicious, and I'm normally not a fan of dumplings! So definitely try some. My husband loved the bamboo salad, but I found it an acquired taste. We also had a beef soup and the meat was so tender it just melted in your mouth.

Best dim Sam in the world \",,,,,,,2016/8/6, Youll have to fight the crowds here but oh boy is it worth the wait. Everything is freshly made and cooked. Try the prawn and pork sui mai the truffle pork dumplings and the soup buns. Spectacular. Have a set menu of seasonal chef chosen things for around 500NTD. So much food so damn good\,,,,,,,2016/8/5," This property is fantastic, we just loved the food The staff are very friendly and the restaurant was very clean. You can see the photos on the wall of when Tom Cruise came and tried to make dumplings.Our service was amazing it is a must stop in Taipei.\",,,,,,,2016/8/5," I had been to Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong and in Manila. really liked their food and i find their prices reasonable.As expected, the queue is really long. You just have to be early so you can get the best seat and not subject yourself to a long wait while looking at their food. This is both for the 101 Branch and the one inside the Sogo Mall. Love their food. Good service as well.\",,,,,,,2016/8/4, Beautifully presented food- good for vegetarians and at such a reasonable price. Extremely friendly staff and in a great location- good place to each before heading up to see the views at the top of Taipei 101\,,,,,,,2016/8/3," I really didn't want to write about Din Tai Fung because it's so ubiquitous. I heard that even San Francisco has a 3 storey DTF restaurant now. But on the first day of my work trip, guess where my Taipei colleagues brought me? Yes, Din Tai Fung ","-) and I do agree that no matter where they open their outlets in the rest of the world, Din Tai Fung in Taipei is still the best. Nope, xiao long bao in DTF HK or pork chop fried rice in DTF Singapore do not taste the same. Taipei DTF is still tops...\",,,,,,2016/7/31," Crowd of peoples waiting outside the stores and quick service time, fresh food and convenient, easy to locate, especially the dumplings. the side dishes are also delicious. worth to eat again and again\",,,,,,,2016/7/28, Good location.. very close to 101 tower. easy to find. no waiting. but a bit dissapointed..dumpling was not the same tasty in comparison with original shop in Dongmen.\,,,,,,,2016/7/28," Super friendly service and great, fresh food. You definitely have to try the dumplings which you can watch being made but the restaurant offers a lot of other dishes too.\",,,,,,,2016/7/27, We visited on a Friday around 11,"30 and the place was already packed. The wait of 20 minutes was worth it though. You can watch the chefs making dumplings so incredibly quickly. The dumplings themselves are delicious, and I'm normally not a fan of dumplings! So definitely try some. My husband loved the bamboo salad, but I found it an acquired taste. We also had a beef soup and the meat was so tender it just melted in your mouth. Very glad we decided to wait the 20 mins. Since we had a seat with a good view of the dumpling making station it was almost like dinner and a show.\",,,,,,2016/7/26, Visited two of the branches in Taipei. Food is excellent and well worth the (comparatively) high prices. Friendly and fast service. Avoid the extremely busy hours around lunch and dinner!\,,,,,,,2016/7/26," Went there 30 minutes after opening time, was seated quickly (we were just two guests). Ordering and delivery of food was brisk and efficient. We got the famous xiao long bao, beef noodle soup and pork chop on fried rice and we could barely finish them all - the serving sizes were hefty. Attendants were quick to spot if the tea needs refilling. Great to come here for a quick lunch but won't recommend it if you want to stay long or if you're looking for a relaxing ambiance.\",,,,,,,2016/7/25," We ordered the famous Siao long pao which is far better than the version in the Philippines. We also tried the all beef tendon noodle soup which is also great. The sweet potato leaves was also a great dish. The order comes with complimentary tea pot. They also got plain rice it took quite a few follow up before it was served. We just ordered 1 but after I got back to check the receipt, we were charged 2 orders.

The queue was efficient and fast.\,,,,,,2016/7/25," This restaurant is worth the visit to see the kitchen and wait staff working together. Precision food delivery. Food itself is excellent, with many different dishes that come to the table steaming hot. We got hooked on BON, so that filled many desires. Beer is cold. Don't be put off by large lines waiting to be seated. You can fill out order sheet before going into restaurant so food arrives when you sit down. I didn't want to wait, but very glad I got talked into going.\",,,,,,,2016/7/24," The dumplings lived up to my highest expectations. We had a menu with all kind of dumplings, plus rice and vegetables. While everything was delicious, the truffle dumplings were to die for. The restaurant is modern, simple and very clean. You could see the cooks preparing the dumplings; very interesting to look at. I will return.\",,,,,,,2016/7/23," Great Dim Sum. Lovely food. Quite busy but we turned up and book a table, wander around the shopping centre for about 30 mins then go on in. Good selection of food. It says it's Michelin Star but in not so sure. It's good but not really that style/quality. But it is good. \",,,,,,,2016/7/23," Our Taiwanese host introduced us to this restaurant known for the ""ong queue"" and yummy food. There were five of us. After obtaining a booking ticket for Din Tai Fung (101 branch) we were told that seating would be available in about an hour later. To while away our time we did some shopping in the complex. When we returned to the restaurant an hour later we still had to wait to be seated. The trainee server was most polite apologising for the delay. While queuing our food order was taken. Once that was done we were allowed to view the ""work station"" where the restaurant workers were preparing the food. The restaurant was fully occupied but the seating layout was comfortable. Service was efficient. We ordered about 8 different dishes. We all agreed that the Xio Long Bao was the best. Unlike other restaurants the Xio Long Bao were served at the right temperature without scalding our throat, moist, whole and tasty. The drunken chicken was well presented, moist, meaty with mild wine flavour and in perfect bite size. It was worth the long wait.\",,,,,,,2016/7/20," It was a wait worth for. Was in Taiwan for many business trips and never tried Ding Tai Feng before because I have tried other branches in other cities and they failed. So, this trip, with my husband along for a short trip, we decided to join in the queue. It's worth the wait.Although the restaurant is crowded with people, you can see patrons eating fast and changing fast, the food is better than I expected. When I tried other branches, I am very particular on the porky smell.

In Singapore, I would usually order Egg fried rice and Xiao Long Bao. I wanted to try the authentic Din Tai Fung in Taiwan. Here we are!!! It was very crowded, nevertheless we waited patiently until it was our turn. As usual, I ordered Egg fried rice, Xiao Long Bao and one more"," Hong you chao shou! Indeed, the food did not disappoint and it even tasted much more delicious in Taiwan!!! \",,,,,,2016/7/16, Din Tai Fung was recommended by a friend & I'm glad I made the visit. There was a 50 minute wait to eat in so I got take out. I only eat poultry & fish so unfortunately there wasn't a huge selection for me. But the chicken dumplings I got were very tasty. Would visit again.\,,,,,,,2016/7/14, We ordered to go due to number of people waiting for table. We were told at least 1hr and 30 mins before we could sit at the table ...

Xiao Long Bao's skin compaired to other places are much thinner and taster.\,,,,,,,2016/7/14, come early for your lunch or dinner to beat the queue. and off course the main menu that you should order is the xiao long bao and shrimp fried rice. located near the entrance of taipei 101this din Tai Fung is not to be missed during your visit to taipei. it's totally crowded especially lunch or dinner time. make sure you come early. food quality and service is excellent and fast although it's crowded. I think this is the main point why this din Tai Fung is always full house. \,,,,,,,2016/7/13," We came here to experience the famous xiao long bao. We were initially going to go to the original branch, but after a morning of hiking, the Taipei 101 branch turned out to be the most convenient location. The Taipei 101 location attracts a lot of tourists so the lines are much longer. We had about a 50-minute wait time. The good news is that, once you have your reservation, you can burn the time browsing the various stores in side the building.Let me state at the outset that I have no basis for comparison on the quality of the xiao long bao; this being my first experience. Overall, I would have to say they were okay. Enjoyable, to be sure, but nothing to write home about. The instructions about how to eat xiao long bao warn that the soup is hot, but I found it to be warm, at best. The texture was nice and chewy, and dipping it in the soy and vinegar sauce adds a nice dimension. In the grand scheme, this is probably not a dish I would actively seek out again. It was fun to try once.Fortunately, the menu at Din Tai Fung is fairly extensive and includes many more enjoyable food options. What was really enjoyable for me was the vegetable and pork wontons in spicy sauce. This is one of my favorite dishes and they make it quite well here. The wontons are really nice and chewy. They are not overcooked/boiled as I have found to be the case at some other establishments.For any vegetarians, I highly recommend the sauteed sweet potato greens. They are sauteed with garlic and taste absolutely divine.It is really fun to watch the xiao long bao being prepared. There are numerous stations in the kitchen (which sits behind a glass window so you can see everything), each with about 5 people playing a specific role in preparing the xiao long bao. One rolls out wrapping, another adds the stuffing, yet another closes the dumpling, and then a final one places them in the steamer. Really fun to watch the teamwork.Overall, a fun experience and certainly one I would recommend you try at least once if you have not done so before. Just be sure to temper your expectations regarding the xiao long bao.\",,,,,,,2016/7/11," Always crowded and filled with tourists. A good place to bring foreign colleagues and friends thoughWe arrived at 8pm on a monday and there is a 30min wait according to the clock. Don't go anywhere though, as we got a table in about 10 min.

Service even better\",,,,,,,2016/7/10, We had to take an hour and 15 minutes by train and MRT from Keelung Cruise Port to the 101 building just for the Xiao Long Bao. The dumpling wrapping is very thin but yet it is able to keep the juice with the grounded pork inside. The beef tendon with noodle in soup and the dumpling in red oil soup are also our favorite. The price is reasonable and the services are great. A long commute to this restaurant is worth. It tastes even better than the famous shanghai Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao.\,,,,,,,2016/7/9," Since this is a must eat to go when in Taipei, we went here as part of our Taipei101 visit.

Really nice place, but in my eyes nothing special.\",,,,,,,2016/6/28, It is disappointing that I was told Din Tai Fung used to be near the Taipei Main Station but they have closed it down. We headed to 101 Branch to join the usual mad queue for our lunch. The wait time was quick much better than in Singapore probably they have a larger seating capacity.For those who love the usual traditional dim sum dont expect much of it here as it is a fusion dim sum place. They are famous for their xiao long bao. It is good to go with groups and you can get to eat variety. If one need to eat noodles dont be afraid to order they will give you small bowls to guests to share. In this way you get to try as many variety.Guests can watch the open concept kitchen where the dim sum is made. There is no language barrier. The staff have a badge stating the flag where that language is spoken. So be brave and do not hesitate and ask their opinion and recommendation. Beware it is pricey too if you compare with traditional dim sum and also the kind of restaurant you are patronising.You can also buy soveniors of Din Tai Fung mascots home for your friends and family or for yourself.\,,,,,,,2016/6/28," I was told by my host that this was a very special restaurant and indeed it is. You are able to watch the entire process through a large glass plane and the food is served fresh. They are famous for gourmet chinese dumplings (hope not to offend, but that is what I know them as), and the varieties offered compare to none. Expect a 45 minute wait time to get into the restaurant. The texture of the dumpling is very light and they are served steaming hot so be careful when taking the first bite. \",,,,,,,2016/7/2," We did not know what to expect, but it was great.

Also tried their noodles and dumplings and both are equally delightful. The broth of both their Xiao Long Bao and noodles are just to die for!

The difference is that you have to walk through the, sort of sometimes, shady areas surrounding some of the best Asian cuisine in United States. I say this having sampled dim sum in San Francisco, Los Angels and New York. Ok, don't get me wrong, we had a great lunch but in the comfort of a really boring environment. For me, I'll take the real deal any day. To be fair the soup dumplings were crazy good but are about the same as Noble Court at twice the price. The vegetarian dumplings are great but try the barley dumplings at Shanghai and you will be just as pleased. The spicy won ton was terrific but Mackeys in Issaquah is as good or better (you can expect Macky to serve them) and again, less money for a great experience.

I really liked everything except the hot and sour soup (it's good, but not something I would order again). As previous reviewers mentioned, for the steamed pork dumplings the ideal sauce concoction is 1 part soy sauce and 3 parts vinegar mixed with the fresh ginger.Service was excellent and exact. This chain has its internal operations really together (from waiting for a table, to seating/ordering, to paying). Even though everything is going a mile a minute, you still feel that you are being well taken care of, which is pleasant in the hustle and bustle that is Taiwan.For lunch, the restaurant officially opens at 11 a.m. But, if you're in the area (and hungry), if you stalk the place out at 10",45 a.m. you may be able to waltz right in to a seat if they open early.

The pork dumping has less soup than expected and the chicken dumpling was blend, even the fried rice was blend. Overall little disappointed. Maybe this place had become a tourist trap?\",,,,,,,2016/6/3, Came here at 4,30pm on a Friday which was just perfect because we got seated within 5 mins which is a rarity even for Din Tai Fung in California.

I would say that the food is good with the hand made dumplings freshly made to perfection with the juicy soup oozing out of the xiao long bao (also know as a dumpling) and overall the soup noodles I had was good not oily with great service as well.However, the wait time was 70 minutes to be seated crazy to me for a slightly overpriced dumpling for my taste","1. 5 pieces of Crab Roe and Pork Xiaolong Bao $175 NTD (New Taiwan Dollar) which equals $7.45 AUD2. Truffle Pork Xiaolong Bao $450 NTD3. Steamed fish dumplings $170 NTD4. House steamed chicken noodle soup $240 NTD5. Stick rice $75 NTD Was the food good and tasty YES, was it worth the money hmm debatable. I would recommend everyone to try Din Tai Fung once as the food is good if you are willing to pay the price the price is worth it considering the location being right under the 101 tower and that the service is really good and the restaurant is immaculate. However, would I say that this type of food is like to die for no not really I guess it is because Din Tai Fung has become so commercialised for my taste that it is to capture my attention. Although not saying anything bad about Din Tai Fung like I said I would recommend people to at least try once but it is nothing special in my opinion. And the price is the same as you would pay in Sydney I guess for me for something so small of a food the cost is high to my liking.I hope this helps you readers and foodies and travels make a decision to go or to try other restaurants that make similar dishes but without the price tag and the long wait time\",,,,,,2016/5/30," We have a Din Tai Fung in Seattle, and have been there only twice.

The smaller size has the advantage of giving us a chance to enjoy the balance between the dumpling's skin and the pork inside, rather than being overwhelmed by a big ball of pork meat in a mouth-full.

On getting to the bottom floor of the building, we noticed that there was no queue for the Din Tai Fung! This is amazing considering most people are prepared to wait over an hour to eat a meal at this famous restaurant.First off, for a place that has a Michelin Star, the prices are a huge surprise. It's really not expensive at all for what you get, which means you can eat a lot without losing all your foreign exchange. The service is really on the ball. We happened to notice a mistake on our bill but it was magically rectified by the waitress who brought us our drinks - they're constantly checking every single tiny detail on your table to maintain that star!We didn't just have the dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) but we also had wontons in chili sauce and noodles in peanut sauce. Everything was up to scratch but obviously the dumplings are the best.The only downside is that you might feel slightly rushed here, but this wasn't the only place in Taiwan where I felt that dine-and-dash was the way to do things. I guess it comes with the popularity of the place, the massive volumes of people and the queues.But go after 8pm and you'll likely have a more relaxing gastronomic experience.\",,,,,,,2016/4/15, We came here last March with my husband...The food was all very nice....Everything we ordered was delicious .

Service was immaculate from start to finish, and in English. The size of dishes was adjusted to ensure that I did not order too much food, a blessing when you're on your own and want to taste several things. I had a variety of dim sum, including lovely crab roe and pork xiaolongbao, and all were good. Shrimp and pork wontons in spicy sauce were also delicious. The only let-down was the hot and sour soup.

Must try if u visit Taiwan! i know most Malaysia visitors will say ""we have din tai fung in malaysia"" But must try this one. Taste way better than malaysia.\",,,,,,,2016/4/15," What a wonderful surprise! We visited Taipei 101 later on in the evening one day and were done with the sight-seeing at about 8pm. On getting to the bottom floor of the building, we noticed that there was no queue for the Din Tai Fung! This is amazing considering most people are prepared to wait over an hour to eat a meal at this famous restaurant.First off, for a place that has a Michelin Star, the prices are a huge surprise. It's really not expensive at all for what you get, which means you can eat a lot without losing all your foreign exchange. The service is really on the ball. We happened to notice a mistake on our bill but it was magically rectified by the waitress who brought us our drinks - they're constantly checking every single tiny detail on your table to maintain that star!We didn't just have the dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) but we also had wontons in chili sauce and noodles in peanut sauce. Everything was up to scratch but obviously the dumplings are the best.The only downside is that you might feel slightly rushed here, but this wasn't the only place in Taiwan where I felt that dine-and-dash was the way to do things. I guess it comes with the popularity of the place, the massive volumes of people and the queues.But go after 8pm and you'll likely have a more relaxing gastronomic experience.\",,,,,,,2016/4/15, We came here last March with my husband...The food was all very nice....Everything we ordered was delicious .

Excellent service attitude! Affordable! Is a particularly fine dining experience! \",,,,,,,2016/3/24," When our group decided to have a meal at this place I was concerned because of numbers of us (100 plus) going there at the same time. Obviously we were made to stand outside of the restaurant like bunch of castles while waiting for seats. Surprisingly those staffs quickly overcome the problem with efficient and courteous manners.The food came pretty slowly obviously with the large numbers but it is extremely well done. Some of the taste may not be perfect but still in consideration of the size of crowds, it is superb.Not much of ambience to be proud off but seatings were designed to be eat and go type. Overall, good place to go for good Taiwanese Chinese food.\",,,,,,,2016/3/23," Fortunately, I went with friends who knew exactly what to order! I was amazed at the baskets and baskets of dumplings that arrived at our table. I was also amazed at how quickly they disappeared. Din Tai Fung takes dumpling-eating to a whole new level!

Also great service, many of whom speak multiple languages!!\",,,,,,,2016/3/22, Very tasty dumplings. On first sight Looks like a more fast food place - it is absolutely not. In the back there are separate dining rooms for groups. The Food quality and taste is outstanding. A great experience.\,,,,,,,2016/3/21," Long queue but worth the wait! Tried a variety of dumplings and they were all very good. All in all, a very satisfying meal.\",,,,,,,2016/3/21," OMG! OMG! I just can't find the words to say on how exuberant I was to eat here! The waiting time can be long, like a minimum of 20 minutes to an hour but it's all worth it. So better line up before you even become famished. Make sure to decide well and make your orders ready once they call your number and be sure to pay attention when your number is called as they won't wait for a long time before they call the next one. The service is very professional and warm, they even have multilingual staff to help you.\",,,,,,,2016/3/21," This restaurant continues its high standards of food and service. Although a busy lunch time the staff were so efficient and calm one had no inkling of so much going on around.The staff are neat and tidy, friendly and efficient.

You can't beat the first Taipei restaurant but the one in Shanghai is more spacious and comfortable than Singapore. The staff are helpful and polite and the food is excellent. I recommend the dumplings. I specially like the pork dumplings but struggle to keep them whole as I am a novice with chopsticks. Break them and you loose the goodness inside. The hot red bean soup is also delicious as a desert. \,,,,,,,2016/2/26," It took 10 minutes for us to get a table but it is absolutely worthy of waiting. The skin is so thin, filling is juicy. Never disappointed, I hightly recommend two vegetables dish which can hardly get in Australia, bamboo shoot and stir fry snow pea sprouts, simple, fresh but yum and healthy as well. Besides, waitress are so friendly and attentive. Overall, very enjoyable !\",,,,,,,2016/2/25," It is no surprise that at almost every Din Tai Fung location I have visited, long lines form. Been to 2 different ones in Taipei and also visited locations in Singapore. I live in California but have yet to visit their restaurant in southern cal because the wait is just too long. But enough about the lines. Once seated the food is awesome! The dumplings are a must! This is their flagship product. But I also love all their other dishes. Usually order their Dan Dan Noodle and beef noodle soup. some of the portions are on the small side but if you accompany them with dumplings it is just right. A visit to Din Tai Fung has never been a disappointment and while on vacation it is worth the wait. The 101 branch stops taking names at around 9","30. But if you go at around 9 ish, depending on the size of your party, the wait isn't as long. The same is most likely true for all locations once the dinner rush is gone.\",,,,,,2016/2/25," Din Tai Fung is one of my favourite dumplings franchise. Dumpling definitely is e signature dish, with clear instruction of tasting the original favour and with vinegar.

You can take a queue number, they will advise you when to come back and then you can go take a walk around the mall before coming back. The restaurant operates very efficiently and the service is very attentive i.e. your teacup is always refilled, your bags are covered , etc.Must eats"," Pork Xiaolong Bao, Pork Chop Fried Rice (with Egg), Shrimp and Pork Wantons with House Special Spicy Sauce and the Steamed Taro Xiaolong Bao (dessert)\",,,,,,2016/2/25," This restaurant is ideally located in the shopping part of the 101 complex. The food is among the best in the city if you like dumplings. The food is light in flavor and easy to eat. Very delicious and wholesome. I have tried various restaurant franchises in different countries, but they just don't taste the same. They are good, but still the Taipei restaurants are still far better and more authentic. Price wise it is reasonable, there are cheaper restaurants around but for my money, I would still visit these as I know the quality is the same time after time. I guess the ingredients are different in different countries, so the taste will change. If you are in Taipei you must visit at least one of the Din Tai Fung outlets you will be glad you did.\",,,,,,,2016/2/25," Wow delicious, we ate here twice during our 5 day stay! This placed is packed everyday by the locals and dumpling lovers! Don't be discouraged by the queue, these guys have their tables turning over very quickly and a number system to ensure everyone gets a spot in the waiting line (clever and efficient), 15 minute wait tops! The pork soupy dumplings are delicious, also try cucumber salad, spicy wontons, green beans and the pork buns. Vegetarians, this is not the place for you!The restaurant is huge and you get the chance to watch the dumplings being made in the kitchen through the glass.\",,,,,,,2016/2/24," If you are in Taipei, try this restaurant and enjoy the famous dumplings.

The hot red bean soup is also delicious as a desert. \,,,,,,,2016/2/26," It took 10 minutes for us to get a table but it is absolutely worthy of waiting. The skin is so thin, filling is juicy. Never disappointed, I hightly recommend two vegetables dish which can hardly get in Australia, bamboo shoot and stir fry snow pea sprouts, simple, fresh but yum and healthy as well. Besides, waitress are so friendly and attentive. Overall, very enjoyable !\",,,,,,,2016/2/25," It is no surprise that at almost every Din Tai Fung location I have visited, long lines form. Been to 2 different ones in Taipei and also visited locations in Singapore. I live in California but have yet to visit their restaurant in southern cal because the wait is just too long. But enough about the lines. Once seated the food is awesome! The dumplings are a must! This is their flagship product. But I also love all their other dishes. Usually order their Dan Dan Noodle and beef noodle soup. some of the portions are on the small side but if you accompany them with dumplings it is just right. A visit to Din Tai Fung has never been a disappointment and while on vacation it is worth the wait. The 101 branch stops taking names at around 9","30. But if you go at around 9 ish, depending on the size of your party, the wait isn't as long. The same is most likely true for all locations once the dinner rush is gone.\",,,,,,2016/2/25," Din Tai Fung is one of my favourite dumplings franchise. Dumpling definitely is e signature dish, with clear instruction of tasting the original favour and with vinegar. Braised beef noodle also taste lovely and authentic. 101 branch offers you shopping to kill e time, while you need to wait for the table.\",,,,,,,2016/2/25," We came here on a Sunday afternoon and had to wait for 50 minutes for a table. You can take a queue number, they will advise you when to come back and then you can go take a walk around the mall before coming back. The restaurant operates very efficiently and the service is very attentive i.e. your teacup is always refilled, your bags are covered , etc.Must eats"," Pork Xiaolong Bao, Pork Chop Fried Rice (with Egg), Shrimp and Pork Wantons with House Special Spicy Sauce and the Steamed Taro Xiaolong Bao (dessert)\",,,,,,2016/2/25," This restaurant is ideally located in the shopping part of the 101 complex. The food is among the best in the city if you like dumplings. The food is light in flavor and easy to eat. Very delicious and wholesome. I have tried various restaurant franchises in different countries, but they just don't taste the same. They are good, but still the Taipei restaurants are still far better and more authentic. Price wise it is reasonable, there are cheaper restaurants around but for my money, I would still visit these as I know the quality is the same time after time. I guess the ingredients are different in different countries, so the taste will change. If you are in Taipei you must visit at least one of the Din Tai Fung outlets you will be glad you did.\",,,,,,,2016/2/25," Wow delicious, we ate here twice during our 5 day stay! This placed is packed everyday by the locals and dumpling lovers! Don't be discouraged by the queue, these guys have their tables turning over very quickly and a number system to ensure everyone gets a spot in the waiting line (clever and efficient), 15 minute wait tops! The pork soupy dumplings are delicious, also try cucumber salad, spicy wontons, green beans and the pork buns. Vegetarians, this is not the place for you!The restaurant is huge and you get the chance to watch the dumplings being made in the kitchen through the glass.\",,,,,,,2016/2/24," If you are in Taipei, try this restaurant and enjoy the famous dumplings. Going to 101 location aloes for s night market stop, tour of 101 and shopping all in one location. Get a number first to secure your table. \",,,,,,,2016/2/24," Yes you line up. However as a couple your number gets called quite quickly. We missed our number however was seated within 5 minutes. They are opening all over the world now, but nothing beats eating at the origin. Love the instructions on how to eat them as well. Definite for your itinerary.\",,,,,,,2016/2/23, This place is justly famous for the dumplings and I find that everything I have tried is excellent. Wait times for a table can be long. \,,,,,,,2016/2/23," I learned once I got to Taiwan that a trip to Taipei is not complete without going to Din Tai Fung! It's a very nice restaurant, but I didn't exactly understand all the hype.Even with the reservation for our party, the line to get in was pretty long. This is a huge restaurant with so many private dining rooms and then the regular dining areas. The fact that they can keep food coming out so quickly and evenly is certainly a testament to the restaurant's management.Because we were luckily with a local, they mainly ordered for us. The soup dumplings were the their traditional specialty, and they were very tasty. However, I do have more of a penchant for the larger soup dumplings that you find in mainland China. For me, the best dish was the fried pork.My group was split, with some people thinking it was the best meal they had in Taiwan, and others not really getting it. They certainly have a lot of choices for food, and the food came out pretty quickly. Their open air kitchen that everyone walks by to go to their table is impressive and immaculately clean. Overall, this restaurant is a bit frenetic, but it's worth a visit.\",,,,,,,2016/2/21," Lots of people but they can manage the queue very effectively so we wait just 5 minutes and when the table was ready, our food came right away.I did like this one in the photo. Cannot remember the name . It contained shrimp and pork .\",,,,,,,2016/2/21," By the time we arrived at the restaurant, there was a sign showing the waiting time will be 40 minutes. As we had limited time, we decided to order the takeaway and enjoyed it at the food court area.Waited like 10 minutes, the foods were ready. The dumplings tasted the best!\",,,,,,,2016/2/20," This is a very popular place for visitors, I find a the food is good, but not that good to wait for 30-45 minutes. Many other places sell similar food.\",,,,,,,2016/2/20, Very good food with very fast service. You might need to wait long but it's worth to wait. It's a favourite spot for the Japanese coming to visit Taipei. Do try the delicious desserts. \,,,,,,,2016/2/19, I had there with my friend who visit here .All kinds of dimsum are very delicious .Their staff very nice to explain to my friend how to use chopstick .\,,,,,,,2016/2/18," Dumplings, baozi, shaomai for every taste. Exquisite combinations of flavours, countless choices, served in a traditional and elegant manner. Excellent service and location, extremely fresh ingredients.\",,,,,,,2016/2/18," During traveling for 6 days, I've visited various of Din Tai Fung restaurant in Taipei. In common things, I ordered Shrimp fried rice. It tastes AMAZING. Not salty, Not oily, DELICIOUS!! \",,,,,,,2016/2/18," We have visited on three seperate occasions and every time the food has been amazing and the service impeccable!Surprised to see a western waiter, soo cool!Down side you can't book, just take a ticket and a menu and it's only a short wait to be seated.\",,,,,,,2016/2/16, Din Tai Fung (101) was worth every minute of the wait. I love how efficient the place was too. You got a number; a waitress checked off your order and when you were seated the food was served. Incredible dumplings. I've had them many places but nothing like these! Also had wonderful sauteed spinach greens & a minced pork & noodle dish. No complaints with any of the dishes. Everything was cooked to perfection. The staff in the back was worth a photo op. Go!\,,,,,,,2016/2/15," I have tried Din Tai Fung in 3 different countries and The 101 branch at Taipei is my favourite. Love their chicken dumplings. Long wait time during lunch but you get to make your food selection whilst in queue and once you get your table, food is served almost immediately. Don't miss this whilst in Taipei.\",,,,,,,2016/2/14," The dumplings are about the same, but the care they gave for the trufffle filled dumplings in Taipei, WOW!!! And they were awsome!!!!! They don't do that in Shanghai.\",,,,,,,2016/2/14," We went there on first day chinese new year. Queue for 2 hours! But all that compensated by the taste of the xiao long bao!!! We tried before in Kuala Lumpur but it was not good. A friend of ours said this 101 branch has the best xiao long bao and he was right! Not only the food, but the staff were very friendly and enthusiastic helping you.\",,,,,,,2016/2/14," The restaurant has both take out and dine in option. Its quite popular with locals and travelers, so ensure you go there with time. There are enough vegetarian options on the menu. The portions are quite small to worth ordering multiple things. The spicy noodles with dumplings and buns is great combination.\",,,,,,,2016/2/13, Wish I could move here to keep eating their yummy food. Big place but spacing of dining hall makes it less overwhelming. Service good. One hour wait for a table at 1pm.\,,,,,,,2016/2/10," To be honest, I had been trying out DTF over the world.Every time when I eat there is that the time I have no better options.Do not mistaken here, their dim sum is far more better then the one you had in Shanghai. The Shanghai one really sucks,My concern is that, you couldn't taste the spirit of the mince pork because they are likely to be machine made in meeting the daily volume.A real dim sum eater could differentiate the taste of real dim sum mince meat and machine made. i reveal the secret here. Rough cut, details chopping.Ip there are better options for the small soup bun. China Shang Zheng ji actually do it right, however the best still in Taiwan due to the raw material of the pork. Taiwan has good pork. Just that couldn't supply the whole market demand due to cost.Back to DTF, their noodle is acceptable. It's still a myth Michelin give them stars, could you imagine MC D get stars from such important food Oscar award? It's not bad, it's something daily and somehow I felt overrated. Anyway, it does taste better then MCD.If you want someone better, try DIAN SHUI LOU.\",,,,,,,2016/2/10, Visited this branch as I heard it's better than the original one at Yong kang street. I find it to be as good as the original shop. Q is quite long but the service is efficient and friendly.

Going in a group has the advantage that you can try much more food while still leaving the restaurant stuffed. Between the 4 of us, we have easily shared minimum 10-15 different items and loved each and every one of them.

The size of the 101 branch is way much bigger then the original Ding Tai Fung.The food is equally good!There is always a full crowd of people waiting outside this restaurant but the wait time is reasonable (about 20 to 30 minutes). It is better to book in advance to avoid the crowd. The service here is very good and the place is very clean! The atmosphere is warm and relaxing. What\'a1\'a6s good about this branch is that you can see the chefs working in a glassed kitchen and see how they prepare your dish.The very thin skin Xiao-Long bao is what they are famous for but their chicken soup is the best compare to all other chicken soup! You can taste the freshness of the chicken without the greasy taste. Their other dumplings and different delicacies are all so yummy! I had visited this restaurant many times and was never disappointed!What I like about Ding Tai Fung is that they will put a folding cart next to each tablefor personal belongings and the cart are covered up so the customers can enjoy the food without worrying about where to put their belongings or to catch extra food stains.

We tried their boiled vegetables, long bean (starter dish), pork fried brown rice and xiao long bao and all of them tasted really really and above average, especially considering the price we normally pay in Singapore (it's cheaper in Taipei).

Only downside was that had to wait 30 minutes to get a table. \",,,,,,,2016/1/5," This is a restaurant chain that serves the famous Chinese xiaolongbao, among other types of Chinese food. We waited for about 40 minutes, which was short by any standards, as the lines were getting longer and longer as we waited. We were given an order form / menu while we waited. We were not disappointed. The restaurant was very large. We walked by the opened kitchen where a bunch of cooks rolled the xiaolongbao and other dumplings. The service was friendly and incredibly efficient, and the food was delicious. We had several orders of xiolongbao, vegetables, fried rice and noodles. All were terrific. Also, there is free flowing Jasmine tea. This is a must go to restaurant that anyone would enjoy.\",,,,,,,2016/1/5," the food here is absolutely delicious. It doesn't matter what you order, you won't be disappointed, but definitely recommend the pork or crab and shrimp dumplings.....they melt in your mouth. This location is way better than the Xynil location as the waiting time is more reasonable and they accept credit cards at this location. \",,,,,,,2016/1/4," Before my visit to Taiwan, my friend had hyped up DTF a lot. And boy was she right. The food is amazing. Anything on the menu is delicious, but make sure you order the soup dumplings(any type). They are perfectly rolled(you can watch the chefs do this when you walk into the restaurant) and fantastic. Definitely make a stop at DTF when in Taipei!\",,,,,,,2016/1/3," Had to wait for 90 minutes for a table. Spent only an hour for the actual meal. The food really lives up to the hype. Everything tastes very good and the price is not that expensive. This is THE place you have to stop by definitely when you're in Taipei. I know there are quite a few branches in the city. So if you want to avoid the crowd, you may consider another branch instead of 101.The xiao long bao is the killer here. The dumplings in special spicy sauce is pretty tasty too.Recommended for anyone going to Taipei!\",,,,,,,2016/1/3," We visited Din Tai Fung at Taipei 101 for dinner. It is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant.We already had a reservation but still waited for 20 mins to get a table. The waiting time for walk-ins is even more.We were lucky to see the owner and took a picture of him. The photo I have uploaded is bit blurry/shaky as it was taken in a hurry.There were variety of dumplings served to us. Prawn dumplings, pork dumplings,noodle soup. Dessert was red bean dumplings. All the dumplings are of same size and they just melt in the mouth. This was our first visit to Din Tai Fung and we simply loved it. One should definitely visit one of the Din Tai Fung restaurants around the world\",,,,,,,2016/1/2," Unlike the other branch, this one accepts credit cards. It also has the added option of being able to order and take the meal to go. The latter being okay since there's lots of seating nearby in the main food court.

Order them in batches of 20.\",,,,,,,2016/1/2, While you might feel a tad bit disappointed after the long wait the food is quite nice and the staff are very courteous as well.All the hype is a bit of an overkill but we did walk out satisfied with the quality of the food and the experience at the restaurant.\,,,,,,,2016/1/2," food should be good, but the wait it usually long. They were low on choices, due to the holidays, and I got the standard soup dumplings and mushroom dumplings. I had my order to go, for a short 10 minute wait, and then ate them in the main eating area around the corner near the food court. Food is somewhat pricey and you can find better, cheaper food at night markets, but you have to try this once to say so. Enjoy\",,,,,,,2016/1/1," With family visiting Taipei first time and decided to try this restaurant out. It was very busy with wait of more than an hour. The restaurant is rather huge which some how is a warning sign to me. Ordered their signature dishes, like dumplings... etc. Most were rather disappointing as they were very similar to those we had back home (Vancouver, Canada). My sister is a frequent visitor to Seattle and she think Seattle's Din Tai Fung is much better, not worth the wait for sure. There are many interesting food places and street food vendors to try. I definitely will get this a pass. A better alternative is to try Taipei 101 food court instead which offers many interesting dishes and good tasting.\",,,,,,,2016/1/1," Too many people waiting in line. Took us almost an hour to get a table. Good thing this branch is inside 101 so we are able to use this time to walk around. The queuing system is very efficient and I noticed they have staffs who can speak Japanese, Korean and English to cater to the different nationalities who dine there. Place is very huge yet well maintained. They are also very attentive and would refill your tea in a snap.We only visited Din Tai Fung for their xiaolongbao. And all I can say is they are really good with just the right amount of soup inside. We also ordered noodle soup and the hot and sour soup (which IMHO I can do without). The rice vinegar paired with sliced ginger strips for the xiaolongbao adds a lot of its flavor. I love the taro xiaolongbao for dessert. It's a must try! (photo shows taro xiaolongbao) \",,,,,,,2016/1/1, Surely lives up to its name and status of one Michelin star. Good services and tasty food. Must try the crab meat Xiao lung Bao. The rest are nice but pretty average. When you're used to delicious cheap hawker stalls this place can seem a bit pricey.\,,,,,,,2015/12/30," This is my 2nd time eating at this restaurant in Taipei even though it's not the same branch. Food still as good, service equally great. Please bear in mind that you have to wait for quite a while if your group is big. My group is 7 of us and we have to wait an hour before we can actually have a table for us to have our food. It's all worthwhile coz their xiao long bao is really good. You don't have to order drinks, tea (jasmine tea) is served throughout. This is a must try restaurant or food when you are in Taipei.\",,,,,,,2015/12/29," Every time I fly to Taipei, I will always make sure that Ding Tai Fung at 101 will be covered in my check list. I'm not a big fan of a franchising network, however Ding Tai Fung at 101 branch still remain Ding old time classic and authentic flavours. I remember the very first time I worshipped Ding when they're still the one and only outlet in Taipei twenty over years ago. After a few experiences of long waiting for our turn to get an available table, the last two times of my visits I was smart enough to get the queue card and place my order first then from knowing the estimate time of waiting, I will decide where to go while waiting for our turn like shop around or even have something light to eat at the food mall just next to Ding if we were too hungry. We went back roughly 10 min before the time estimated by Ding (45min), we were then being attended to our table once we got to the counter. Since we have had something to eat while waiting so we decided to order just the most ""must have"" items like their signature Crab roe and pork xiao long bao, hot and sour soup,oriental wontons in black vinegar and chili sauce, braised bitter melon, preserved vegetable with green soybean and curd sheet. And of course a bottle of their nice house vintage 15 years huadiao wine, preferably warmed up. Even though it's never been easy to get a table at this outlet, but one thing good about being patient was everything were able to deliver to you pretty amazingly fast. Maybe it's too popular and busy round it's business hours, I've realised that servers at Ding were not really patient nor attentive to customers. It gave me an impression of being rush so that they can let the other waiting customers their table like a fast food store. The taste quality of the food has tremendously gone down too just like their services. The only complementing choice was actually the bottle of huadiao wine. We even bought a bottle to bring back to Hong Kong. So after all I might not consider of going back again in the future if I fly to Taipei. There's many more authentic Taiwanese restaurants which are worth going as well and at least no crazy queueing and waiting with huge group of tourists yet being treated as Mac Donald's diners. \",,,,,,,2015/12/29," A bit too busy at the time of our arrival meant the XLB weren't served warm.

Unfortunately, being a person with the fundamental Asian background, I was naturally more critical and picky about the taste of food here. I tried DTF in Hong Kong, but here in Taiwan, where the brand started, I found the taste even plainer.

You can't go to Taipei without stopping here for dumplings.\,,,,,,,2015/12/6," This branch of the very popular Din Tai Fung chain is located in the 101 building in Taipei. I like this location better than some of the other Din Tai Fung restaurants because they have a lot more space, and the interior is spotless. The menu is the same, and the quality is exactly the same, which is to say very very good.\",,,,,,,2015/12/6," We enjoyed our meal at this place. Service is top notch, superior to other DTF's we have been to in Singapore and Sydney. Food similar, perhaps slightly better.\",,,,,,,2015/12/6," We wanted to visit the original location of the restaurant at Xinyi but after seeing the long queue we gave upThe Din Tai Fung at the 101 tower is huge! And given its popularity there is also a queue though it moved much faster the night we were there.The food is outstanding. I'm a regular at Din Tai Fung in Singapore so I went for my favourites - pork soup dumpling, dumplings in chilli oil, dan dan mian (noodles in spicy peanut sauce) and stir fried greens. The staff in particular, as seemed to be the case everywhere in Taipei, were extremely courteous. We were actually helped by a young Spanish girl who was studying in Taipei and working part time at the restaurant. Great restaurant and always highly recommended!\",,,,,,,2015/12/5, Have read so much about this outlet at Taipei 101 so I make it a point to try it and I was not disappointed. It tasted very much better than any of the Singapore branches which I've eaten at. The shrimps on the fried rice ordered were very much more generous as compared to Singapore and price was lower too. The staffs here were also pleasant and it makes the whole dining experience a joy. I came in after 2pm hence the waiting time was very much shorten. Waited for around 15mins. The queue can be very long during the typical lunch and dinner time.\,,,,,,,2015/12/5, We had our lunch there after visiting Taipei Tower 101. We were lucky as we were arranged by our travel agent or else there were many people waiting at the entrance of the restaurant. Inside the restaurant were full house with no seats available if you do not do any bookings or reservations. The food normal like what we have in Malaysia's Din Tai Fung restaurant. Our Malaysian DTF have more choices even like fried rice & other local delicacies but Taipei stick to their original dumpling dishes. The staff pleasant but mainly speak mandarin language....foreigners may have language problem.\,,,,,,,2015/12/4, Went there due to recommendations from local Taiwan people.Tried dumplings and lots of other food.All was delicious excellent and fresh.Interesting to see resturant work and to see how the food was made.\,,,,,,,2015/12/4," They say that your Taipei trip won't be complete without dining at Din Tai Fung. We went to Taipei 101 and we saw the long lines -- that of the observatory and the sought-after restaurant. We opted for the latter. The food are good, especially the xiao long bao, though not really stellar. We were looking for a good mix of vegetable, fish, chicken and pork dishes. Great ambiance and the service is fast and efficient.\",,,,,,,2015/12/3," Din Tai Fung was the only reastaurant I had heard about before I went to Taipei and definitely worth it. The dumplings are great, they hand make them in a glass chamber in the middle of the restaurant and every each one of them is a masterpiece.You might have to wait for a table for maybe even up to an hour but make sure you fill out the order form and from there on the service is great and the food will be on your table in the matter of minutes.Pricy? Yes, but the steamed dumplings are served on a cotton serviette in the bamboo box - just a nice little touch compared to the paper ones they use in other places.\",,,,,,,2015/12/3," Long line but waiting time was shorter than expected. Tried the famous Xiao long bao, noodles and more. To be honest, the food did not give the wow factor but it might be due to how highly raved the place is so the expectations were running high. Nevertheless, it was still an enjoyable meal and the food was still all finished!\",,,,,,,2015/12/3," I Just returned from a trip to Taipei and while I found the overall experience a little underwhelming, Din Tai Fung was a Shinning Star. Personally I am not a big fan of dumplings but these are like little bowls of Asian soup in every dumpling. These are truly a Must try. Follow these truly taste mouthfuls with the Beef Noodle Soup, also outstanding, such flavour in the broth. We were so impressed with our visit for dinner on the Friday night (apart from the 30min wait) we went back on the Saturday 11am for and early lunch comprising of 10 more of the liquid gold chicken dumplings and another steaming bowl of Beef noodle soup.

A lot has been said of the famous dumplings here and they were very good. The main pork dumplings had excellent thin pastry and good soup within it.There is a good choice of different dumplings and we tried various ones which were all very nice.Definitely worth a visit\,,,,,,,2015/12/1," My family loves this place. It's a lone line, usually an invisible line. One picks up a number and waits nearby. For us, it was an one hr wait before four of us got seated. The dumplings, the jawzi, and the xiao long bao are small and delicious. The beef noodles come in a variety of styles, some with the clear broth, some in a heavier brown sauce. The sweet ""loose cake"" or ""thousand layers cake"" would be something to finish a meal with. The hot and sour soup with the finely shredded bean curds would be something to experience. It's all about the techniques"," you have the xiao long bao, then you have the ones in Din Tai Fung that has not more, not less, but exactly 18 little folds that close the dumpling. When you pick it up, lifting it where those 16 folds are, the dumpling looks almost transparent. Make sure you put it in the spoon, better eat it in one bite because you don't want to miss a drop of the ""soup"" in the dumpling. The reason that these are called ""xiao long ton bao"" where ton means ""soup"" is because there is just one place in the world",-) where the soup is an essential part of the dumpling (the bao).

While the restaurant has moved location a visit when in Taipei is a treat to be enjoyed. This busy restaurant does not take bookings but a wait of 20 minutes is well worth waiting for the delicious dumplings. Service is good and staff are friendly and helpful. Language is no problem for English speakers. This is one location you should have high on your of things to do in Taiwan.\,,,,,,,2015/11/13," Went here while waiting to do 101 - Queuing system is good and is needed due to the crowds wanting to go. I had Drunken Chicken which was OK 5/10, have had much better. Pork and Prawn Dim Sim - Good - 6/10 - again have had much better. Service is good and thoughtful. Really not sure why this is so popular, food is not that great - maybe it says more about quality of food in other places. If doing 101 may as well go here.

It was crazy busy during this time with tour groups and others queueing outside the restaurant. We thought it was a queue for the observatory at first and when we found out it was for the restaurant were put off but in the end we queued and it was worth the wait. Waiting time for us was around 45 mins, there is a notice board that actually tells u how long the estimated waiting time is too. However don't let this put you off. The restaurant is super organised and the way the queueing system works is very efficient and organised. First go to the counter and tell the staff how many people you have in your party. They will then give you an order sheet to fill out, an English menu can be found right in front of the entrance so you can look at the pictures and then mark the corresponding codes and how many of each item you want. Once you are done you hand back in your order sheet and then you are free to wander around until 15 mins before your allotted time, once your table is ready your number will be announced so just show your ticket number to the staff and they will show you to your table. Inside,the restaurant looks very clean, modern and quite elegant. They have bag holders right next to your table and once seated you are then able to leave your seat and go to the centre of the restaurant where you will see the dumpling chefs hard at work. It's definitely worth seeing how they make the dumplings. They work very fast and weigh the dumplings to ensure that each once is the same weight as the one before. We ordered the Shanghai dumplings, fish dumplings, Shao mai, won ton and two portions of fried rice. The dumplings were as good as you would expect them to be, the pastry was soft but had a good bite to it and the soup inside the dumpling was so tasty and sumptuous. The price for four of us came up to NT$1580 about \'a2\'4733 which in my opinion is very reasonable for the quality of food that we got. Also I must commend the service level of the staff. They are very friendly, attentive and polite. The service they provide is also another reason why it is worth eating in this restaurant***Note for first time dumpling eaters","For first time dumpling eaters put some vinegar (and if you like soy sauce) in the little dish with ginger in it first, then place your hot dumpling in the dish for a few seconds to soak up some vinegar and cool down before popping the whole thing in your mouth.

Three words....TO DIE FOR! We went on a Sunday afternoon.....the very busiest day of the entire week. We were warned the wait would be about 75-80 minutes (they were pretty bang on with the estimate) and were handed a queue number to book our spot in line. You're allowed to wander off and come back closer to your number being called. The service is impeccable, polite and friendly and our servers spoke English wonderfully. Our tea cups were filled numerous times and there are little 'carriers' beside the table to set your video camera, purses, etc. in which are then covered with a linen cloth. The specialty of Din Tai Fung are the soup dumplings (Xaio Long Bao) and we ordered three trays of them (10 in each) for four people plus an order of Vegetable and Pork Wontons with House Special Spicy Sauce. It was almost the perfect amount and we were stuffed. ",")The kitchen is open air behind glass and so I took the opportunity to walk over to watch the Chefs making up the dumplings. A lovely young woman from Brazil came over and asked if I had any questions or if she could be of any help with anything. She went on to tell me that on a typical busy Sunday, the chefs make 16,000 dumplings per day. Chefs take a six month course and then work for five years, with a test every six months, until they are competent enough to join the team. Each dumpling weighs EXACTLY 5 grams and they must learn how to do that without any machines. We left very happy and very impressed. If you find yourself in Taipei you MUST go here. MUST! ",) Lunch for four was about $40 Canadian. Extremely good value.\,,,,,2015/10/18," Normally one must shell out quite a few ducats to claim they've eaten at a Michelin rated eatery. Not so here. You'll get some of the best Chinese food available and you'll do so at reasonable prices. That means you can really order up and enjoy stuffing yourselves, there won't be any buyer's remorse. \",,,,,,,2015/10/16, This place had developed the best system to move people through the restaurant with high quality food and service.Sign says how long wait time is. You put down your name for a table. Order food while waiting. Notified when table is ready on a screen. Food arrives just after sitting down. Tea never stays empty. Food is checked off the bill as it comes and flipped over when complete. Your done eating and pay at the front. In and out in 30 min. And yet there is nothing to complain about.They are good.Service is exceptional. Table beside me spilled tea and the waitress stoped talking to us and runs to get paper to wipe down the table. All done with out any attitude.This place is a model for how to run an Asian restaurant.\,,,,,,,2015/10/15, Been told about this place. Everyone told us it was amazing. Getting here we thought we have got our hopes raised to high. But no! This was amazing. Would recommend you to take different dishes to share. \,,,,,,,2015/10/15, The food is good but the price is quite high. The service is satisfactory. They offer traditional common Chinese snacks but the service is like what you will expect in a 5-star hotel. I think it's a good place if you want to dine out with the elderly. But be noted that you will always have to wait.\,,,,,,,2015/10/14," In September while I was in Taipei, my colleagues took me to this Din Tai Fung for dimmer and to try the Xiaolone Pao - the famous steamed dumplings. It is good no doubt, but nothing to write home about. Actually was quite disappointed as I was expecting the Xiaolongpaos to be extraordinarily good. But other dishes like the Taiwan Beef Noodles was declicious.\",,,,,,,2015/10/13," WOW! What a place! One of the best places I have ever eaten at. I went there for my birthday since I happen to be visiting Taipei for work.Delicious Dim Sum, very delicate. It is also a lot less expensive than I ever imagined being a 1 michelin star restaurant.D.O.N.T. miss it\",,,,,,,2015/10/12," The food is good, but I find it to be hyped. I've also had dim sum other places, which I found just as good. However, I went to several Din Tai Fung, and the service at this place was fantastic. Staff was so helpful with recommendations and advice along the way. I had two different kinds of dim sum and a dumpling soup. Please do try it. The prices are very fair!Be aware that there's always waiting time, so don't go if you're in a rush! At least 30 mins around lunch. When I left the restaurant around 12.30, I saw the waiting time was increased to 60 mins.\",,,,,,,2015/10/11," If you don't have time,this is the place to try this kind of food quickly in the food court of the Taipei 101 building.\",,,,,,,2015/10/11," One of the best I've tried.I've had dumplings and beef noodles A polite staff help me to prepare in the right way the tipping sauce with ginger soy sauce and vinegar.Just a dip and put your dumpling on the spoon, a little hole and let the broth to get off. Sublime!Noodles were amazing, pay attention to your shirt.Definitely not expensive, for western people \",,,,,,,2015/10/20," I'd heard of Din Tai Fung when I first visited Taipei in 2014 and made a point of putting it on our 'to-do' list for this trip. Three words....TO DIE FOR! We went on a Sunday afternoon.....the very busiest day of the entire week. We were warned the wait would be about 75-80 minutes (they were pretty bang on with the estimate) and were handed a queue number to book our spot in line. You're allowed to wander off and come back closer to your number being called. The service is impeccable, polite and friendly and our servers spoke English wonderfully. Our tea cups were filled numerous times and there are little 'carriers' beside the table to set your video camera, purses, etc. in which are then covered with a linen cloth. The specialty of Din Tai Fung are the soup dumplings (Xaio Long Bao) and we ordered three trays of them (10 in each) for four people plus an order of Vegetable and Pork Wontons with House Special Spicy Sauce. It was almost the perfect amount and we were stuffed. ",")The kitchen is open air behind glass and so I took the opportunity to walk over to watch the Chefs making up the dumplings. A lovely young woman from Brazil came over and asked if I had any questions or if she could be of any help with anything. She went on to tell me that on a typical busy Sunday, the chefs make 16,000 dumplings per day. Chefs take a six month course and then work for five years, with a test every six months, until they are competent enough to join the team. Each dumpling weighs EXACTLY 5 grams and they must learn how to do that without any machines. We left very happy and very impressed. If you find yourself in Taipei you MUST go here. MUST! ",) Lunch for four was about $40 Canadian. Extremely good value.\,,,,,2015/10/18," Normally one must shell out quite a few ducats to claim they've eaten at a Michelin rated eatery. Not so here. You'll get some of the best Chinese food available and you'll do so at reasonable prices. That means you can really order up and enjoy stuffing yourselves, there won't be any buyer's remorse. \",,,,,,,2015/10/16, This place had developed the best system to move people through the restaurant with high quality food and service.Sign says how long wait time is. You put down your name for a table. Order food while waiting. Notified when table is ready on a screen. Food arrives just after sitting down. Tea never stays empty. Food is checked off the bill as it comes and flipped over when complete. Your done eating and pay at the front. In and out in 30 min. And yet there is nothing to complain about.They are good.Service is exceptional. Table beside me spilled tea and the waitress stoped talking to us and runs to get paper to wipe down the table. All done with out any attitude.This place is a model for how to run an Asian restaurant.\,,,,,,,2015/10/15, Been told about this place. Everyone told us it was amazing. Getting here we thought we have got our hopes raised to high. But no! This was amazing. Would recommend you to take different dishes to share. \,,,,,,,2015/10/15, The food is good but the price is quite high. The service is satisfactory. They offer traditional common Chinese snacks but the service is like what you will expect in a 5-star hotel. I think it's a good place if you want to dine out with the elderly. But be noted that you will always have to wait.\,,,,,,,2015/10/14," In September while I was in Taipei, my colleagues took me to this Din Tai Fung for dimmer and to try the Xiaolone Pao - the famous steamed dumplings. It is good no doubt, but nothing to write home about. Actually was quite disappointed as I was expecting the Xiaolongpaos to be extraordinarily good. But other dishes like the Taiwan Beef Noodles was declicious.\",,,,,,,2015/10/13," WOW! What a place! One of the best places I have ever eaten at. I went there for my birthday since I happen to be visiting Taipei for work.Delicious Dim Sum, very delicate. It is also a lot less expensive than I ever imagined being a 1 michelin star restaurant.D.O.N.T. miss it\",,,,,,,2015/10/12," The food is good, but I find it to be hyped. I've also had dim sum other places, which I found just as good. However, I went to several Din Tai Fung, and the service at this place was fantastic. Staff was so helpful with recommendations and advice along the way. I had two different kinds of dim sum and a dumpling soup. Please do try it.

Waiting time about 30 minutes. We were guided to our table and got An excellent explanation about the way to order and to enjoy our dinner. Appetizers, soup, dumplings, hot dishes, everything tasted great. Very good value for money. It's nice to watch the dumplings being made. \",,,,,,,2015/10/11, First time to try in Taiwan. The restaurant is huge and the seating comfortable. You can see the staff preparing the dumplings thru a glass partition which is typical for this restaurant. We arrived early for dinner. No reservations. You got to take a queue number at the lady in front. They have a board for average waiting time to be seated. We were quite lucky that Sunday since it was only 30 minutes to wait from around 4pm to around 6,"30pm. We passed by Xinyi branch on another day and there was a long queue outside. Ordered Xiao Long Bao (Pork and Pork with Crab) plus Pork Chop Fried Rice. Yummy!!! Have been a big fan of Din Tai Fung for a couple of years now. My go to food place in Singapore and Hong Kong. The skin on the the dumpling was so thin here! Taste wise, the xiao long bao's I think are fairly consistent with other DTF's. I think this is the best one I've eaten among all the DTFs. We went there with some locals (colleagues of my sister) and she mentioned this was the flagship branch and pointed out the owner to us. We tried xiao long bao's wherever we find them during are stay in Taipei (street food or restaurant) and I still prefer Din Tai Fung's.\",,,,,,2015/10/8," There is a reason that this place is famous. Get ready for a long wait to get seated, and prepare to walk up several flights of stairs, but food will arrive shortly after you order, and is worth the wait. The larger your party, the more you will get to taste. We ordered WAY TOO MUCH, but it was all heavenly. \",,,,,,,2015/10/7," I told my husband that I wanted to go to Din Tai Fung because it was recommended by many friends and I wanted to compare if it's indeed better than the Din Tai Fung we had in Beijing.Anyway, we skipped breakfast and went there quite early with empty stomach. But when we got there at 11.20am (yes I timed it!), there was already a long queue outside. Luckily we waited only 25 mins so we wondered around in 101, and by the time we were seated, everything was already set up properly with children's set and tea poured.We didn't order much, but I have to say with everything we ordered it was actually better, maybe it's also due to the service was definitely up a notch comparing with Din Tai Fung in Beijing.I definitely recommend Din Tai Fung to anyone visiting Taipei - it's an art to watch how Xiao Long Bao is being made, and it's delicious! And of course to go there early - It was already 50 mins wait by the time we left!\",,,,,,,2015/10/4," The xiao long bao here was the best food we had in our entire 2-week Taiwan trip. Go on a week-day and get here early, the lines form quickly! We paired our visit here with a trip to the Taipei 101 top floors. Got to the tower at 9 AM, left at 10","15 AM, and made it to the restaurant at 10","45 AM, right in time for it to open at 11 AM. We got a table right away and loved what we ordered -- from the XLB to the taiwanese lettuce to the beef noodle soup. DELICIOUS! (Might suggest skipping the steam buns with pork and veggies, still good but not as good as the XLB).\",,,,,2015/10/4," Apart from the fact that there can be about a 40 minute wait during peak times, nothing else can be faulted. Service is always outstanding, staff are friendly and the food has always been fantastic. The location is also brilliant, situated at the base of Taipei 101. I would class it as a 'must-visit.'\",,,,,,,2015/10/3," food was really good and although there was so much queue, however, we didn't wait very long. The price was cheaper than Ding Tai Fung Macau. \",,,,,,,2015/10/3," Love going here either with my husband who loves dumplings or my girlfriends. The food is always great and the staff are friendly and makes sure that you get what you exactly need. Always ready with the tea! Only down side to this restaurant is that during lunch and dinner time, there is always a long line of people just to acquire a reservation.\",,,,,,,2015/10/1, Got here around 11am. No queues. Enjoyed everything. Food was delicious! (better than the Hong Kong branch) was around NT1300 ($60AUD) for 3 of us and we were well and truly bloated.\,,,,,,,2015/9/29," Went here on our last day, so had a pretty good idea of what to expect from Taiwanese food. We waited around fifteen minutes, as caught the end of the lunch rush, but were given a menu and order card in the queue so the time wasn't wasted. They also called out the queue numbers in English for English speaking guests and Chinese for the local guests, which is a clever move. Service was impeccable, with details such as racks for handbags adding a nice touch. The food started to arrive fairly soon after we sat down and was all perfectly cooked. Flavours, as with most food in Taiwan were generally mild and soy based, but the spicy dishes we ordered were very good and even the more mild dishes still had some decent flavours.The restaurant is a little hard to find for English speakers as it's marked on the map in the 101 shopping centre in Chinese only... look for the group ticket booking centre to the observatory, it's next to that entrance.\",,,,,,,2015/10/11," After visiting the 101 observatory we went to this great place.

But if you did no worries there is the possibility of asking for a doggy bag. 3min after being sitted we had our first dish. All of them were excellent. Really different from everything european people know, but so tastefull and flavourish. No worries an explanation about how to eat xaio long bao will be given to you in several languages. Everything worth to try again and again. Tea will be serve instead of water and as soon as your cup is not totally full, someone will bring you more tea. It was really fast and the staff is really attentive about your needs.

The restaurant specializes in Xiaolongbao and it was almost too difficult to select which dishes to order.To start off, everything is fresh. From the starters and side dishes to the soups and steamed dumplings, everything arrives to your table piping hot and flavorful. Ordered some steamed dumplings and potstickers, it was all delicious.

The l\uc0\u224 ji\u257 o ji\u224 ng (chilli sauce) was a highlight, interesting and savoury - a house blend, which seems to be a Taipei specialty.We had to wait 15 mins for a table, but the staff and queue method were efficient.We'll be back.\",,,,,,,2015/9/17, Had their famous xiaolongbao for the first time! It was amazing! The line was long but worth the wait! I would definitely go again.\,,,,,,,2015/9/16, We came here expecting a long wait for dinner. Maybe because we showed up early at 5,"30 pm we only waited like 5 minutes and were swiftly shown to our table. The waiter was very helpful and instructed us on how to devour the Sui loong bao with a little ginger and red vinegar. Then when the dumpling variation with the truffles came, he advised us to clear our palate with some Chinese tea, and to eat these delicious morsels without any accompaniments. Boy what a delight these were.We also ordered some steam sweet buns for dessert and we couldn't fit any more food. The service was quick and expertly executed. No wonder they get so many people through the door. My whole family loved the food and it didn't break the bank. Great place.\",,,,,,2015/9/16," It's a MUST try food in Taipei.

This is my first time dining in Taiwan Din Tai Fung and the food is good.Standard is pretty much the same in Singapore but some dishes do stand out.I particularly adore the beef noodle soup. Soup is flavorful and the beef is really good. Soft and juicy unlike the one in Singapore that is quite hard. In Taiwan, one can choose either beef meat/ tendon or a mixture.My son loves the Xiao Long Bao served and we had to order a second serving for him. He is only 3 years old and had 6 Xiao long Bao, he really like it very much.Hubby mention that glutinous pork dumpling is good but I wasn't a big fan.For dessert do go for glutinous rice cake with red bean (song gao), love it's chewy texture and goes really good with the red bean filling. Price is really reasonable despite its location in Taipei 101. Do come early especially during peak hour as they do not accept advance reservation.

They brought a menu like a cheap street food menu just one sheet and they insisted to order our food while waiting outside.Shame on you no etiquette and embarrassing in front of our guest.See their menu in the picture I have attached.Basically she was telling us if we don't order now we can't get in.

Immediately the food was on the table. They had very sharp eyes as soon a plate was getting empty they removed it from the table, but didn't bother to refill the water on the table.We all felt very tense and horrible experience.For the money we spent there we could easily eat in a 5 star hotel.Most people going there are just going there because it is famous. Maybe in their life never ate in a proper restaurant, that's why they don't realize that a restaurant in that price range should not treat their customer in this way.I never go there again and I had to apologize from our guests about this experience. This is not one off case, they are trained to finish customers in this way. The point is many customers may not realize this rip-off. Look at their menu.\",,,,,,,2015/8/18, We waited about 20 min to get a seat for 2 people. The menu is slightly different from what you would get in Singapore DTFs.

There are english menu available. There are bags/baskets for handbags/backpacks/plastic bags next to your chair for your belongings to be put into when seated. Food came promptly and the wait staff was friendly. The signature xiao long bao was definitely great as we ordered a few different variants. Other dim sum food items are average including the noodle dishes which are on the subtle side. Serving size is average for the price.

All i ate was the boiled cabbage. \,,,,,,,2015/8/14," Situated in the Taipei 101 building. This is extremely popular and you often have to wait for a table to be free, but whilst waiting you can watch the staff prepare and make the Dumplings. The food is excellent, so if you are in a group - order a selection so that you can try as many different flavours as possible. Best Dumplings I have ever had and will definitely visit again....and again.\",,,,,,,2015/8/13," The wait wasn't that long unlike in HK.

My sister and I waited 70 minutes just to be seated. This was after lunch period.. we came at 2","30PM. The xiao long bao (dumpling with soup fillings) was excellent. The beef noodle was good as well. We ordered 8 flavours sticky rice and it was delicious. If you visit Taiwan, make sure to stop by at this restaurant. Note on the side, better come at late afternoon, as the waiting time will be shorter. We passed by this restaurant at 6",30PM and waiting time was over 2 hours!\,,,,,2015/8/13, We went at 10,"30am on Monday and got a table straight away. Staff were very polite and friendly. Never had to ask for our tea to be topped up or for plates to be taken away as the staff were very attentive! Food (as per all DTF we've tried) was very good. If anything, it tasted better than usual so we left feeling very satisfied with our meal. Loved the pot stickers with the crispy bottom. And of course the XLB was amazing! Definitely pay DTF a visit even if it's a regular back at home. Must do in Taipei!\",,,,,,2015/8/13," good but kinda overrated. there are many dimsum places just as good.

They had very sharp eyes as soon a plate was getting empty they removed it from the table, but didn't bother to refill the water on the table.We all felt very tense and horrible experience.For the money we spent there we could easily eat in a 5 star hotel.Most people going there are just going there because it is famous. Maybe in their life never ate in a proper restaurant, that's why they don't realize that a restaurant in that price range should not treat their customer in this way.I never go there again and I had to apologize from our guests about this experience. This is not one off case, they are trained to finish customers in this way. The point is many customers may not realize this rip-off. Look at their menu.\",,,,,,,2015/8/18, We waited about 20 min to get a seat for 2 people. The menu is slightly different from what you would get in Singapore DTFs. The key is to just ordered whatever is different/recommended. I really enjoyed the sesame bao!The service was top-notch. I thought I splashed some sauce on my clothes and the waitress immediately approached me to ask if I need help cleaning up. And this was even when the restaurant was at full capacity!\,,,,,,,2015/8/18," This is the best restaurant in Asia! The flavors are simply incredible. Every item is meticulously prepared. There are photos of Tom Cruise wearing an apron in the kitchen during his visit. Next time I'm in Taipei, a meal at this restaurant will be at the top of my list!\",,,,,,,2015/8/15," We decided to try the 101 branch after coming down from the 101 observatory. We (2 person) only have to wait around 10min compared to the Xinyi branch. Once our number was called, we were escorted to our table and by then we'd already selected what we wanted from the menu. There are english menu available. There are bags/baskets for handbags/backpacks/plastic bags next to your chair for your belongings to be put into when seated. Food came promptly and the wait staff was friendly. The signature xiao long bao was definitely great as we ordered a few different variants. Other dim sum food items are average including the noodle dishes which are on the subtle side. Serving size is average for the price. Definitely would try the other xiao long baos from the menu and also from other branches\",,,,,,,2015/8/14, Super clean place.Best hostess and table service i have had in a long time. Shame the food was not as good.There are views into the kitchen but it looked more like a NASA research lab than a kitchen. Very busy place and had to wait approx 30 min to get a table. All i ate was the boiled cabbage. \,,,,,,,2015/8/14," Situated in the Taipei 101 building. This is extremely popular and you often have to wait for a table to be free, but whilst waiting you can watch the staff prepare and make the Dumplings. The food is excellent, so if you are in a group - order a selection so that you can try as many different flavours as possible. Best Dumplings I have ever had and will definitely visit again....and again.\",,,,,,,2015/8/13," The wait wasn't that long unlike in HK. The place is not cramped that it's more relaxing to dine and enjoy. They have a cover for your bags, I don't really know the purpose. XLB is the best here in Taipei. \",,,,,,,2015/8/13," The very famous xiao long bao in Taiwan. There are several branch, but my Taiwanese friend told me to visit the shop in 101. My sister and I waited 70 minutes just to be seated. This was after lunch period.. we came at 2","30PM. The xiao long bao (dumpling with soup fillings) was excellent. The beef noodle was good as well. We ordered 8 flavours sticky rice and it was delicious. If you visit Taiwan, make sure to stop by at this restaurant. Note on the side, better come at late afternoon, as the waiting time will be shorter. We passed by this restaurant at 6",30PM and waiting time was over 2 hours!\,,,,,2015/8/13, We went at 10,"30am on Monday and got a table straight away. Staff were very polite and friendly. Never had to ask for our tea to be topped up or for plates to be taken away as the staff were very attentive! Food (as per all DTF we've tried) was very good. If anything, it tasted better than usual so we left feeling very satisfied with our meal. Loved the pot stickers with the crispy bottom. And of course the XLB was amazing! Definitely pay DTF a visit even if it's a regular back at home. Must do in Taipei!\",,,,,,2015/8/13," good but kinda overrated. there are many dimsum places just as good. Kao Shin, the first shanghai dim sum restaurant is just as good and right around the corner (in Dongman) without the crazy line. good service though. \",,,,,,,2015/8/13," The pork lo bao dumplings keep me coming back, but pretty much anything on the menu that looks good to you will be enjoyable. I was more adventurous this trip and tried the house special appetizer and some different soups. Everything was excellent and up to the high standards of Din Tai Fung. Service is always attentive. My best trick on Friday nights (when the wait time can be up to 70 minutes) is to travel on the MRT and get off at the Taipei 101 station (door 5) and stop by Din Tai Fung on my way back to the Hyatt. You pick up your ticket, and then return to the hotel to wash up and get ready for dinner, and by the time you return your number is coming up on the screen!\",,,,,,,2015/8/12, After many good reviews and advis from colleagues visitied the Din Tai Fung 101 branch.

We had a look at the menu during the wait, once seated the very friendly and fluently english staff read over your order with you and advised us we had to much. Very friendly! Withon 10 minutes food starter to arrive, from hot and sour soup to string beans and their lovely dimsums. We where with three friends and had a selection from everything and all items tasted delicious! With a tall beer and a few extra items ordered because things where overly delicious the bill was 1600 TWD (less then 60 USD) for three persons (service charge already included) which for the quality of food is extraordinary!Will definately visit again!\",,,,,,2015/8/12, We got there at around 11,"00 AM so we did not have to wait for a table. Service was very good. Food was not so bad. The original xiao long bao were better than the one with crab.The restaurant is huge, so turn over should be faster. I would go there again next time.\",,,,,,2015/8/11," Excellent Dim Sum, efficient service, and well worth the wait for your seating. The dumplings were some of the best I've eaten, and the price was great too. \",,,,,,,2015/8/11," The XLB didn't disappoint, neither did the prawn and pork dumplings or the pot stickers! For dumpling eating novices, they give you instructions on how to eat them! The food is great and very cheap. Chinese tea is complimentary and always was topped up. We went on a Sunday at around 4.00pm and didn't have to wait at all. Great to watch the chefs making the dumplings through the glass window too! \",,,,,,,2015/8/4," Even if this restaurant served nothing tasty but the pork and crab roe xiaolongbao it would still be worth the waiting time. The taste is delicate, the dumpling skin improbably thin and strong, the whole thing mouthwatering. But luckily there are other delicacies - noodles, starters (green beans!) or excellent sesame buns for desert. Absolutely recommended in spite of how busy and noisy it is.\",,,,,,,2015/8/3," I ordered Xiaolongbao, Shaomai, Fried rice and Sauteed Spinach.All dishes are very delicious and price is reasonable.I'd like to visit this restaurant again.\",,,,,,,2015/8/3, I have tried Din Tai Fung in HK and in Korea but this was my favorite of all.The xiao long bao was great! the green beans is so good together with the shrimp friend rice.I don't recommend the noodles with peanut sauce... it was the least favorite among the orders we've had.The service was great too and we only waited less than 10 minutes because we arrive a bit earlier than the dinner time.\,,,,,,,2015/8/2," Din Tai Fung has always been overrated since it only had a store near Yongkang Street. The steamed dumplings are not as good as other restaurants in Taipei (such as those on Aiguo E. Road). Now all the Din Tai Fung restaurants are so overcrowded and the wait is at least an hour most of the time. The worst part is, that Ding Tai Fung used to be frequent by Japanese tourists (and locals), but now it's almost exclusively overrun by Chinese tourists.Find you shiaolongbao elsewhere and thank me later.\",,,,,,,2015/7/31," Din Tai Fung is a must visit to any visitor to Taipei. I can't compare to the other branches but this one made for an excellent and yummy visit!All branches are busy but this one can be especially busy with tourists since it is conveniently located at the base of Taipei 101 tower. However, the staff are so well trained that I was amazed how efficiently and fast the queue moved along. Service is friendly but no-nonsense.Food is amazing and really I can't add much more about the food than what already has been written. Just Google Din Tai Fung and read some reviews.

It was worth the queue. My friend said it is because the Taiwanese pork is better than the Aussie pork. Whatever it is, it is denitely a must go if you are in Taiwan and you like dumplings.

This is a big thing in chinese restaurants abroad, as it can be hard to order exactly what you want, and be confident that you will get what you think you have ordered!It was a lot of fun watching the dim sum being constructed, weighed and cooked. Our meat eating friends had a great time and ordered many more dishes than we could. I know this is an extremely successful chain, but other fish/veg dishes would be greatly appreciated.Food came out promptly, tea was plentiful and we had a really good evening. The only negative is that we had a 90 minute wait before eating, so some of our group waited for the table at 101 and others sat in a coffee shop near by.It would be good if DTF had a better way of managing the queues.\",,,,,,,2015/6/23, The Xiao long bao is consider best in town and other choice of vegetables (they come with a small portion) also worth to try\,,,,,,,2015/6/23," My favourite restaurant in Taipei. All of the Din Tai Fung restaurants are busy at all times, due to their fame and the popularity of the soup dumplings. For me either the original one or the Taipei 101 are my favorite. I just love the soup dumplings and the fried rice with pork chop. But actually all dishes you get here are marvellous.Whenever you have the chance, try the Din Tai Fung soup dumplings, one of the few Chinese restaurants that actually has a Michelin star (for the Hong Kong branch that is) \",,,,,,,2015/6/22," Great bustling ambience and consistently good dumplings every time I've visited (at least half a dozen by now).

My first encounter with it was in Singapore Crsytal Jade, it's really so soft, juicy and full of taste.

This place very near the Taipei 101 was teeming with people. One had to notify the staff the number of guests and I got a waiting number which can be seen on a TV screen. There different queues for different number of guests-for example-separate queue for 1-2 guests, 3-4 guests, 5-6 guests and 7 and more had a separate line. As I was waiting for my number I realized the place was immensely popular. There is place to the left of the entrance where one can get frozen Dim Sums and one can take home and steam them or wait if line as I did. The food and service was spectacular. The servers also had westerners, they immediately got a bag where I could keep my back bag and they covered it. The range of Dim Sum was immense and food was certainly getting over fast. The quality of Dim Sum, taste was very good and one could literally dig in for the rest of the evening. This place is also famous as Hollywood actor Tom Cruise visited here and tried his hand in making Dim Sums(pictures all over the wall). One can see the food also being prepared with speed and in a very Hygienic Manner. Its very exciting and an experience but be there early to avoid the long waiting.\",,,,,,,2015/5/29," I consider myself a foodie and have had many soup dumplings in my day- it is one of my favorite foods.

Skip the dan dan noodles, although they looked delicious on yelp and trip advisor- just order tons of soup dumplings and some of the black sesame mini buns for dessert!As far as price- we spend about $28 USD and got the green beans appetizer, 20 soup dumplings, dan dan noodles (small), taro and black sesame buns. Pretty good deal!\",,,,,,,2015/5/29," Lived up to the hype! Having tried DTF in 3 other countries, I can safely say that the original is the best; DTF in Taiwan is nothing short of amazing!

Half portions also available so suitable for small appetites or if you want to try a variety of dishes.

The only downside, and why I gave it a score of 4/5 is that the starters are shown in pictures and there is no description of what each item actually is. This caused some rather unfortunate ordering.

We went with a local colleague for lunch and got there a bit before the lunch rush \'a1\'56 which is recommended. The space is huge; the area where the dumplings are prepared is enclosed in glass, so you can see them being made. We tried several dishes including the Pork XiaoLong Bao, Steamed Vegetable & Ground Pork Dumplings, and Pork Fried Rice with Egg. It was all super with the dumplings being just amazing. As a westerner, the Snow Fungus Sweet Soup was good, but the texture was between tapioca and slimy. It was really special for our host to pick it out, so I at about half, and it was lightly sweet. The service is super. The staff swarm the floor and simply take care of you instantly \'a1\'56 and yet somehow avoid making you feel rushed. The decor is a bit modern and clean, but I thought the place was attractive with a really good noise level considering the hundreds of patrons. All in all, highly recommended!\",,,,,,,2015/5/18," We waited for almost 1 hour but it worthed it. If you visit the 101 tower, you must a lunch of a dinner. Smiling and helpful staff. And watching the kitchen is a pure show. Need to come back.\",,,,,,,2015/5/14," Fair warning to readers who see all the 5-star reviews. This restaurant has little to no atmosphere. It's certainly not a party hot spot where you're going to get the most innovative in asian cuisine. All that being said, this restaurant is an incredibly solid meal for a group of weary travelers looking for a consistent (and safe!) food choice that isn't going to break the bank. All dumplings and buns are fantastic. I was a fan of the pork buns personally though my crew went crazy on dumpling ordering. We were also pretty split on the black sesame buns which were more dessert than meal - definitely order them and give them a try!\",,,,,,,2015/5/14, This restaurant-chain has 1 Michelin star - unusual but the food is worth a visit. Reservation is possible but either you call days or weeks in advance or choose 11am or 3pm for lunch...Just walking in means waiting time but it's worth it.

They even offered to serve the sweet redbean dumplings later without me asking as they suggested it's best eaten as a dessert. Half portions also available so suitable for small appetites or if you want to try a variety of dishes. And of course, do not miss trying the different type of dumplings including the originals and the one with spicy chili oil that you must try. As I have a seafood allergy, I was especially glad that they had many vegetable dumpling options. \",,,,,,,2015/5/20," Everything was tasty, and served hot. The only downside, and why I gave it a score of 4/5 is that the starters are shown in pictures and there is no description of what each item actually is. This caused some rather unfortunate ordering. Other than that, the service was great - we didn't have to wait long to be seated and always had drinks in our cups.\",,,,,,,2015/5/20, Foods are fresher in Taipei as compared to Malaysia / Singapore.Worth visiting this in Taipei. Good service provided as well. \,,,,,,,2015/5/19," This restaurant is below street level in the Taipei 101 building. It\'a1\'a6s down to the right before you enter the 101. We went with a local colleague for lunch and got there a bit before the lunch rush \'a1\'56 which is recommended. The space is huge; the area where the dumplings are prepared is enclosed in glass, so you can see them being made. We tried several dishes including the Pork XiaoLong Bao, Steamed Vegetable & Ground Pork Dumplings, and Pork Fried Rice with Egg. It was all super with the dumplings being just amazing. As a westerner, the Snow Fungus Sweet Soup was good, but the texture was between tapioca and slimy. It was really special for our host to pick it out, so I at about half, and it was lightly sweet. The service is super. The staff swarm the floor and simply take care of you instantly \'a1\'56 and yet somehow avoid making you feel rushed. The decor is a bit modern and clean, but I thought the place was attractive with a really good noise level considering the hundreds of patrons. All in all, highly recommended!\",,,,,,,2015/5/18," We waited for almost 1 hour but it worthed it. If you visit the 101 tower, you must a lunch of a dinner. Smiling and helpful staff. And watching the kitchen is a pure show. Need to come back.\",,,,,,,2015/5/14," Fair warning to readers who see all the 5-star reviews. This restaurant has little to no atmosphere. It's certainly not a party hot spot where you're going to get the most innovative in asian cuisine. All that being said, this restaurant is an incredibly solid meal for a group of weary travelers looking for a consistent (and safe!) food choice that isn't going to break the bank. All dumplings and buns are fantastic. I was a fan of the pork buns personally though my crew went crazy on dumpling ordering. We were also pretty split on the black sesame buns which were more dessert than meal - definitely order them and give them a try!\",,,,,,,2015/5/14, This restaurant-chain has 1 Michelin star - unusual but the food is worth a visit. Reservation is possible but either you call days or weeks in advance or choose 11am or 3pm for lunch...Just walking in means waiting time but it's worth it. Dumplings in all variations and fillings - that's the way to go.Service is fine but not matching the food. I have to disagree with flashbite - they take cards as well not only cash.\,,,,,,,2015/5/12," So I've been to countless dumpling shops, many soup dumpling restaurants and several Din Tai Fungs in the world. This one may be the best.The dumplings here are to die-for. Honestly, if you find yourself in Asia, you should take a weekend trip to Taipei to eat here. As a whole, people in Taipei are super nice and the nightlife is fun. But it all comes back to food. Dumplings... wow!\",,,,,,,2015/5/11," This restaurant is really recommendable due to its absolutely outstanding Chinese dumpling compositions - the best ever I have tasted so far! BUT - you should reserve a table before - otherwise the waiting time might be between 0.5 - 1 hours. Also, with larger groups, it is quite difficult to find a place where all are close by. And - be aware that the washroom as at the other end of the building and not in the restaurant - this might complicate a harmonious stay. \",,,,,,,2015/5/9," Ding Tai Fund is a famous restaurant in Taiwan. It is famous for it's ""Xiao Long Bao"" aka small pork steam bun. No doubt that is delicious. But, you can find some other shop which is selling something on par with this shop. The minus for this shop is the long queue, the pricey food, and average food. It is good to have a try as it is some sought of Taiwan signature.

It's simply amazing!The restaurant is listed in the Michelin guide and rated as 1 star. Nothing to say, everything is good, the service is excellent and the price are not expensive BUT has nothing to compare with the European 1 star Michelin. I think because is one of the best in Taiwan had this prize but not the best compared to the similar ones in the world. There is no toilet inside the restaurant so if you need you have to go to the public restroom of the Taipei 101 and walk 5 minutes. Anyway is an experience that has to be lived. Very good!\",,,,,,,2015/4/27," This is the second time I have visited this restaurant in the last year and once agin it was simply great....superb food in a bustling environment.

The services are superb.\,,,,,,,2015/3/10," While exploring Taipei 101 a few weeks ago, we decided to brave the posted 100-minute wait for a table when we saw how organized the Din Tai Fung process is for dealing with long lines. We were issued a ticket by a very helpful reception employee who instructed (in perfect English) that we would be seated when our issued number fell within the ranges of the numbers displayed on a large overhead screen. We were given a menu in English with photos and told we could place our order right then and there at the reception desk and that we could add to our order at any time after that. We were assured that if we decided to leave the area and missed the calling of our number, they would fit us in at the next open table. Sure enough, we walked around Taipei 101 for 90 min and when we returned, our number range was on display. We were seated immediately. This restaurant is a marvel of efficiency and it's impressive to walk by the kitchen assembly line 'surgeons' frenetically at work. The famous Micheline-rated dumplings are unlike anything we'd ever had, delicate little purses of savory broth lined with minced pork that melt in your mouth. There were English instructions on the table that recommend piercing the dumplings with a chopstick to release the juices into a large soup spoon containing a little black vinegar, soy sauce and chiffonade of ginger root. The saut\uc0\u233 ed Taiwan Lettuce side dish, cucumber salad pyramid and red bean paste dessert buns were equally delectable. The wait staff were abundant and attentive and the prices are low. A marvelous experience and well worth the wait.\",,,,,,,2015/3/10," This is a shop that cares about customers. They advice you the waiting time and arrange RSVP by no. of pax. Normal waiting time is easily 40-60mins. However, because it's located in the shopping mall, time passes fast.The food here was good and cheaper than in Singapore! They have some new adds like the bitter gourd cold dish, yum yum!The fried rice in my opinion was not as good as the one in Singapore but everything else were fantastic!Love it, never fail to visit when in Taiwan!\",,,,,,,2015/3/8," Noodles, dumplings, vegetable dishes, deserts, all prepared very well with subtle delicious flavors. All-you-can-drink tea and a feeling that you can relax there after eating. We returned three times.\",,,,,,,2015/3/4, The food here was great and reminded me of the food that I had had in Thailand and Hong Kong. They are amazing worth the wait.\,,,,,,,2015/3/2," Compared to Din Tai Fung, Shanghai\'a1\'a6s best local brand of dumplings and steamed buns (Nan Xiang) is a mere joke \'a1\'56 poor services, worrying hygiene, shabby overall presentation and nasty attitudes. Tried this branch store of Din Tai Fung over the recent Spring Festival with family members. The queuing line was very long and curiously, it took only 20 minutes for us to be seated. The secret is"," take a stroll around this branch store (there are a LOT of quality food stalls near this store) and sample certain items to your liking, before coming back to check whether your given table number is about to be called. All waiters and waitresses are genuinely smiley and extremely polite. The speed of food delivery is efficient"," we ordered 7 varieties and they arrived one after another in a controlled pace. Some serious training must have been done on these personnel. The waitress looking after our table made a few hearty recommendations which we found out to be absolutely yummy!!!I love their \'a1\'a7beef noodles with soup\'a1\'a8 in particular. It is the BEST-flavored of its type on this planet. I say this after trying hundreds of fine Chinese restaurants worldwide. More importantly, the prices in Taipei are evidently cheaper than the prices in Shanghai (they have a branch store very near my office building in Shanghai. The flavor is almost the same. But the prices in Shanghai are up to 30% more expensive than in Taipei, due to the notorious inflation in the Mainland).\",,,,,2015/3/2," We were told not to go to the original as the queues would be longer and the time to wait longer over the holidays. There is more to do in the area around the 101 outlet and plenty to look at whie you wait. Excellent attentive staff, very efficient, lovely food and of course all those dumpling varieties\",,,,,,,2015/3/1," Every time I welcome family or friends in Taipei is the best excuse for me to go and show them Din Tai Fung. To my knowledge, they always achieve to impeccably serve on of the best typically-Taiwanese food. The waiting line can be a drag, but it's actually not long at all if you go for lunch.\",,,,,,,2015/3/1, The long queue here is intimidating but so worth it. Get your number and prepare to hang out in the mall while you wait - they have a very organised system so it is not too stressful. They seated our party of 12 including a toddler and were super attentive and speedy with the service. Faster than Singapore branch we frequent for sure. The pork soup dumplings and shrimp and pork shaw mei were absolutely delicious! We always get these two in Singapore and I was pleasantly surprised that they were even better here! Vegetable dumplings and pork buns were also great. Our friend is a strict vegetarian and they special made a couple items to accommodate his needs which was much appreciated also. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Taipei! Don't miss out ,) \,,,,,,2015/2/28," we make sure to drop by Din Tai Fung Taipei 101 branch on our trip to Taipei. Original plan to have lunch there but since there a long waiting line we decided to have lunch else where and come back for a snack in the afternoon. The service was amazing waiter are well train, very polite and courteous. Since my mandarin is a bit rusty an english speaking waiter was there to take my order. The food was really good, we order dim sum and soup. The prices seem reasonable too and another thing that impress me is how systematic and orderly they handle their business.

We were assured that if we decided to leave the area and missed the calling of our number, they would fit us in at the next open table. Sure enough, we walked around Taipei 101 for 90 min and when we returned, our number range was on display. We were seated immediately. This restaurant is a marvel of efficiency and it's impressive to walk by the kitchen assembly line 'surgeons' frenetically at work. The famous Micheline-rated dumplings are unlike anything we'd ever had, delicate little purses of savory broth lined with minced pork that melt in your mouth. There were English instructions on the table that recommend piercing the dumplings with a chopstick to release the juices into a large soup spoon containing a little black vinegar, soy sauce and chiffonade of ginger root. The saut\uc0\u233 ed Taiwan Lettuce side dish, cucumber salad pyramid and red bean paste dessert buns were equally delectable. The wait staff were abundant and attentive and the prices are low. A marvelous experience and well worth the wait.\",,,,,,,2015/3/10," This is a shop that cares about customers. They advice you the waiting time and arrange RSVP by no. of pax. Normal waiting time is easily 40-60mins. However, because it's located in the shopping mall, time passes fast.The food here was good and cheaper than in Singapore! They have some new adds like the bitter gourd cold dish, yum yum!The fried rice in my opinion was not as good as the one in Singapore but everything else were fantastic!Love it, never fail to visit when in Taiwan!\",,,,,,,2015/3/8," Noodles, dumplings, vegetable dishes, deserts, all prepared very well with subtle delicious flavors. All-you-can-drink tea and a feeling that you can relax there after eating. We returned three times.\",,,,,,,2015/3/4, The food here was great and reminded me of the food that I had had in Thailand and Hong Kong. They are amazing worth the wait.\,,,,,,,2015/3/2," Compared to Din Tai Fung, Shanghai\'a1\'a6s best local brand of dumplings and steamed buns (Nan Xiang) is a mere joke \'a1\'56 poor services, worrying hygiene, shabby overall presentation and nasty attitudes. Tried this branch store of Din Tai Fung over the recent Spring Festival with family members. The queuing line was very long and curiously, it took only 20 minutes for us to be seated. The secret is"," take a stroll around this branch store (there are a LOT of quality food stalls near this store) and sample certain items to your liking, before coming back to check whether your given table number is about to be called. All waiters and waitresses are genuinely smiley and extremely polite. The speed of food delivery is efficient"," we ordered 7 varieties and they arrived one after another in a controlled pace. Some serious training must have been done on these personnel. The waitress looking after our table made a few hearty recommendations which we found out to be absolutely yummy!!!I love their \'a1\'a7beef noodles with soup\'a1\'a8 in particular. It is the BEST-flavored of its type on this planet. I say this after trying hundreds of fine Chinese restaurants worldwide. More importantly, the prices in Taipei are evidently cheaper than the prices in Shanghai (they have a branch store very near my office building in Shanghai. The flavor is almost the same. But the prices in Shanghai are up to 30% more expensive than in Taipei, due to the notorious inflation in the Mainland).\",,,,,2015/3/2," We were told not to go to the original as the queues would be longer and the time to wait longer over the holidays. There is more to do in the area around the 101 outlet and plenty to look at whie you wait. Excellent attentive staff, very efficient, lovely food and of course all those dumpling varieties\",,,,,,,2015/3/1," Every time I welcome family or friends in Taipei is the best excuse for me to go and show them Din Tai Fung. To my knowledge, they always achieve to impeccably serve on of the best typically-Taiwanese food. The waiting line can be a drag, but it's actually not long at all if you go for lunch.\",,,,,,,2015/3/1, The long queue here is intimidating but so worth it. Get your number and prepare to hang out in the mall while you wait - they have a very organised system so it is not too stressful. They seated our party of 12 including a toddler and were super attentive and speedy with the service. Faster than Singapore branch we frequent for sure. The pork soup dumplings and shrimp and pork shaw mei were absolutely delicious! We always get these two in Singapore and I was pleasantly surprised that they were even better here! Vegetable dumplings and pork buns were also great. Our friend is a strict vegetarian and they special made a couple items to accommodate his needs which was much appreciated also. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Taipei! Don't miss out ,) \,,,,,,2015/2/28," we make sure to drop by Din Tai Fung Taipei 101 branch on our trip to Taipei. Original plan to have lunch there but since there a long waiting line we decided to have lunch else where and come back for a snack in the afternoon. The service was amazing waiter are well train, very polite and courteous. Since my mandarin is a bit rusty an english speaking waiter was there to take my order. The food was really good, we order dim sum and soup. The prices seem reasonable too and another thing that impress me is how systematic and orderly they handle their business. We definite visit again when am in Taipei.\",,,,,,,2015/2/28," Taipei is a really cool city full of various restaurants. Try them all, but at least try this one once. There are several locations, I tried the one near Taipei 101 (the big tower) down town. Seating was immediate and the tea was hot and quick. Ordering is easy if you speak Chineses, but fortunately I had a waiter that spoke English. They do provide English menus if you ask for them. There is one reason to come here....the dumplings! They are hot, made fresh right there in the building and absolutely delicious. Be careful....like I said, they are hot and you will burn your tongue if you arent careful! The waiter was gracious and attentive and the experience was completely authentic! I will search this place out again when I return later next year. There is a franchise in the US in LA, which is pretty good as well. I dont believe they take reservations, but there wasnt a long wait. I would highly recommend this place for a quick lunch while site-seeing in downtown Taipei\",,,,,,,2015/2/26," After a long day of shopping for tea sets at Yingge Ceramic Street, we wanted to go to Ding Tai Fung and have a big dinner since we haven't really eat anything for lunch. However, we took bus in the wrong direction. Then we took another bus to go back to the city but that bus went around in big circle. We got to the city around 9 pm tired and hungry. We took subway to Ding Tai Fung 101 branch. We were afraid that they would stop taking order already by the time we got there. We got there at 9.45. They told us to order before they'd stop taking order at 10! We were so glad. We waited for 10 minutes and we were seated, waited another 10 minutes and all the food came! All dishes were really good. Service was fast and attentive. All staff were happy and smiling. We never once had to ask for anything. They came by to fill our tea cups, took empty plates away, made sure we got all the food we ordered. One word for Ding Tai Fung - impressive! After getting lost taking the buses, hungry and tired, Ding Tai Fung was definitely an awesome place to end our day.\",,,,,,,2015/2/25," Din Tai Fung served possibly the best chinese cuisine ive ever had.

I recommend ",)\,,,,,,2015/2/22," This restaurant owes its name to its very good food and good service. This branch is at the basement of the 101 Building. Visitors flocked to this restaurant by virtue of its name will be very satisfied. The management has made a very efficient process by giving numbers to people waiting for seats outside. They are being encouraged to place their order in a sheet, and once seats are available, their foods are being served at once. This allows the flow of people and shorten the waiting period. Foods are excellent and services are good, though it is a bit dearer! This has our understanding considering it's good name.\",,,,,,,2015/2/21, We had heard from a friend to be sure to try this restaurant while we were in Singapore and were surprised when our guide took us to this branch when we were on a cruise ship stop in Taipei.

Everyone in our group was thrilled to know we would get another chance to dine at Din Tai Fung when we got off the ship in Singaore! \,,,,,,,2015/2/21," This is the best restaurant in the world for me.

Many visitor go there because of its reputation and do prepare to have 2hr- 2.5hr to wait for a table. The food is really delicious with a very reasonable price. This is my third time in two years to this restaurant. This should be must-eat restaurant if visiting Taipei.\,,,,,,,2015/2/21, I think this chain fast food group is over-rated and over-priced.

Ordered beef noodle soup (this wasn't very good), normal xiao long bao (nice but not as nice as the crab roe), vegetable dumplings (jiaozi) - wasn't that great, stir fried spinach with bean curd skin - average and stir fried green beans (very average).

There is an elevated covered walkway going across the street to the Hyatt and the convention center (two escalator levels up from the restaurant) so my pattern was to stop by Din Tai Fung coming out of the MRT Station, check in and get my number for the wait list, and then walk over to the Hyatt to drop off my briefcase and get ready for dinner. By the time I got back I had usually cleared the wait list and could go right in, led by the smiling, helpful hostesses. On an eight day trip I will usually eat here five times; it is the perfect dinner after work. The Hyatt breakfast buffet and Din Tai Fung for dinner is all I need to keep going for the entire day.

Even though the 6 of us had one order of dessert (the steam cake with red bean paste), they gave us new plates and chopsticks.My only comment about the food is that they make even the ordinary (hot and sour soup, fried rice) taste defined.

Din Tai Fung is so popular that they have opened branches in the US, as well as in other parts of Asia, which I have also tried, but none can compare to Taiwan's branches, this is where it all started and this is where they do it best. Usually if the wait is long, there's a good reason for it. And you can see them make the xiao long bao (steamed dumplings) by hand in the back. We had the pork steamed dumplings, dan dan mian (noodles with peanut sauce), niu rou mian (beef noodle soup) and shrimp pan-fried dumplings, and they were all delicious.I went to this branch located in Taipei 101 on a weekday around 1045 am and there was NO WAIT at all. The food was fresh, and it was nice and quiet. We noticed that there was about 50 people in line by around 12pm, which is when we left.

No matter what time of the day you visit you will eventually have to wait a minimum of 30 min. The wait will be worth it. Every dish tasted great. No matter what dish you order you will be happy. We had the beef noodle soup, Juicy Pork Dumplings, and the Shrimp & Pork Shao Mai. It all goes well with Taipei Beer. Be sure to visit Din Tai Fung at Taipei 101 or at one its other locations.\",,,,,,,2014/11/16," I had intended to go the restaurant at the top of 101 but the queue to get up there put me off. And so I settled for DTF.It was a wait longer than the queue to get to the top but they had a system going.The food was excellent and if one did not have to wait, would have been a worthwhile experience.\",,,,,,,2014/11/16, Had a really delicious dinner here - but be prepared to wait we waited over an hour but it was definitely worth it.Very buzzy atmosphere and great tasting dumplings a must in Taipei!\,,,,,,,2014/11/13," yes this branch of this favourite dumpling joint of mine is located at the base of one of Taiwan's main tourist attraction. Yes it is also in one of Taipei's glitziest up market shopping malls.So should I be surprised that the front of the restaurant on a Sunday resembled a train station filled with people waiting and looking longingly into the restaurant from the outside?Well if I was a foreigner, probably would not have had a clue.So for all you foreigners who do not have a clue here's a hint.Go straight up to the counter where you can pick up a number for being in the queue AND the menu that you will get on a clipboard so you can make your menu selection.You pass the latter back to the waitress who will keep it.Then you just wait till your number is called.The day I visited I was told it would be around 80 minutes yes you heard me ... Eighty minutes before I would probable get my table.So you don't really need to hang about I guess if faced like me with such along wait and you could easily go for a stroll and come back maybe 20 minutes before the gestimated time your table would be ready.Alternatively as I had done, I walked less than 20 meters to very large food court and had my meal there within 5 minutes, selecting from the many food outlets there.The choice is yours.\",,,,,,,2014/11/12," We've been going to Din Tai Fung restaurants in the basements of Sogo Department stores but the owners must have known that they needed to expand into other places, other cities, and othercountries including US, there is 2 in Southern California. Try it, You'll Love it!! Gotta warn you, there is always a line during lunch & dinners..... BUT IT IS WORTH THE WAIT !!!\",,,,,,,2014/11/10," There is plenty of restaurants in 101, and even more around in nearby malls, no further than 5min walking. And I never had any problem with getting a table in any of them without a reservation. But in Din Tai Fung, I never waited less than 40 minutes in a line. I think this explains everything - even if people have multiple places to eat around, everyone (tourists, locals, businessmen, etc) waits to do it here.When I was invited here for the first time by my Taiwanese friends I wasn't really excited - since I'm Polish, and dumplings are huge part of our culture and national heritage (we call them PIEROGI) it didn't look promising to travel 7kkm to try asian variation of my national dish. I was sooooo wrong. Dumplings as DTF are nothing like pierogis or any other dumplings I ate (including momos in Nepal & Tibet), and they don't even cost as much (prices in Taiwan are relatively lower than in EU or US). Omitting this place while visiting the city is like visit Paris and didn't go to Eiffel Tower, or going to Warsaw and didn't try local vodka. Just do it.\",,,,,,,2014/11/6, It was the best ever ding tai fung I had tried. It was crowded and be prepared for long queue. I like it so much!\,,,,,,,2014/11/6, we waited in line for lunch for 30 minutes and the clock then said 40 minutes but we where seated and ate the famous Xiao Long Bao. it is worth the wait .\,,,,,,,2014/11/4," For the best dumpling experience, one needs to visit Din Tai Fung, reigning dumpling restaurant in Asia with many imitators. First it is interesting to see the open kitchen enabling one to see the dumpling made fresh. I never experienced such a wide assortment of dumplings even though the popular meat dumplings are still my favorites. Once you place your order of the variety of dumplings you want to sample, the dumplings come to you in steamer baskets as quickly as you order them. What makes these dumplings extraordinary is the delicate wrappings which don't break when you pick them up but, are still al dente when the burst of the soup and filling explodes in your mouth...so one does have to be careful about not burning the inside of your mouth when eating these dumplings. The only dumpling that I did not care for was their prized truffle dumpling which tasted too ""woody"" for me. Bottom line this is a must visit restaurant when you are in Taipei. There are several branches. We were at the Taipei 101 branch. I understand the the restaurant chain is extremely strict in maintaining its standards of consistency to ensure the quality of dumplings are consistent among their chain of restaurants. Try to go during the slow dining hours or else prepare to stand in line although the line moves quickly\",,,,,,,2014/11/17," It's pricey, relatively small portions, can get loud and crowded and the wait is usually long, but it's still a MUST if you're visiting Taiwan for a few days.

Yes it is also in one of Taipei's glitziest up market shopping malls.So should I be surprised that the front of the restaurant on a Sunday resembled a train station filled with people waiting and looking longingly into the restaurant from the outside?Well if I was a foreigner, probably would not have had a clue.So for all you foreigners who do not have a clue here's a hint.Go straight up to the counter where you can pick up a number for being in the queue AND the menu that you will get on a clipboard so you can make your menu selection.You pass the latter back to the waitress who will keep it.Then you just wait till your number is called.The day I visited I was told it would be around 80 minutes yes you heard me ... Eighty minutes before I would probable get my table.So you don't really need to hang about I guess if faced like me with such along wait and you could easily go for a stroll and come back maybe 20 minutes before the gestimated time your table would be ready.Alternatively as I had done, I walked less than 20 meters to very large food court and had my meal there within 5 minutes, selecting from the many food outlets there.The choice is yours.\",,,,,,,2014/11/12," We've been going to Din Tai Fung restaurants in the basements of Sogo Department stores but the owners must have known that they needed to expand into other places, other cities, and othercountries including US, there is 2 in Southern California. Try it, You'll Love it!! Gotta warn you, there is always a line during lunch & dinners..... BUT IT IS WORTH THE WAIT !!!\",,,,,,,2014/11/10," There is plenty of restaurants in 101, and even more around in nearby malls, no further than 5min walking. And I never had any problem with getting a table in any of them without a reservation. But in Din Tai Fung, I never waited less than 40 minutes in a line. I think this explains everything - even if people have multiple places to eat around, everyone (tourists, locals, businessmen, etc) waits to do it here.When I was invited here for the first time by my Taiwanese friends I wasn't really excited - since I'm Polish, and dumplings are huge part of our culture and national heritage (we call them PIEROGI) it didn't look promising to travel 7kkm to try asian variation of my national dish. I was sooooo wrong. Dumplings as DTF are nothing like pierogis or any other dumplings I ate (including momos in Nepal & Tibet), and they don't even cost as much (prices in Taiwan are relatively lower than in EU or US). Omitting this place while visiting the city is like visit Paris and didn't go to Eiffel Tower, or going to Warsaw and didn't try local vodka. Just do it.\",,,,,,,2014/11/6, It was the best ever ding tai fung I had tried. It was crowded and be prepared for long queue. I like it so much!\,,,,,,,2014/11/6, we waited in line for lunch for 30 minutes and the clock then said 40 minutes but we where seated and ate the famous Xiao Long Bao. it is worth the wait .\,,,,,,,2014/11/4," For the best dumpling experience, one needs to visit Din Tai Fung, reigning dumpling restaurant in Asia with many imitators. First it is interesting to see the open kitchen enabling one to see the dumpling made fresh. I never experienced such a wide assortment of dumplings even though the popular meat dumplings are still my favorites. Once you place your order of the variety of dumplings you want to sample, the dumplings come to you in steamer baskets as quickly as you order them. What makes these dumplings extraordinary is the delicate wrappings which don't break when you pick them up but, are still al dente when the burst of the soup and filling explodes in your mouth...so one does have to be careful about not burning the inside of your mouth when eating these dumplings. The only dumpling that I did not care for was their prized truffle dumpling which tasted too ""woody"" for me. Bottom line this is a must visit restaurant when you are in Taipei. There are several branches. We were at the Taipei 101 branch. I understand the the restaurant chain is extremely strict in maintaining its standards of consistency to ensure the quality of dumplings are consistent among their chain of restaurants. Try to go during the slow dining hours or else prepare to stand in line although the line moves quickly\",,,,,,,2014/11/2," If you are in Taipei do make sure you visit one of the branches. I never made it to the original one but had two fantastic meals in two different branches, one under the Taiwan 101 tower, the second largest building in the world. Arrive early. I was there by chance at 10","30 and decided to join the queue. In no time I was seated and started ordering. My absolutely all time favourite is the XiaoLongBao dumplings, the one with some sauce inside and which needs to cool down a good five minutes before devouring them. They are heaven. I also had another set of dumplings which were spicy plus the grilled pork, both also perfect and memorable. The branches outside Taipei, like those in Hong Kong and Shanghai are much more expensive than here. I wish I had an extra day in Taipei, which, by the way, is one of the most elegant, gentle and enchanting cities I have ever been too. It is extremely clean and the locals are lovely people.\",,,,,,2014/10/29," I have tried dumplings in numerous places and failed to see what the fuss was about. That was until I went to Taipei 101, obviously with low expectations. We ordered a few between two, including their pork and truffle ones for the meat eater. I can honestly say that it was an amazing experience. Who knew that they would take the trouble to make the vegetarian ones so spectacular. The pork and truffle required no words as the facial expression was enough to indicate absolute perfection. The staff are all young and impeccable. They are given thorough training to provide excellent service.\",,,,,,,2014/10/28, - We tried ,"(a) \'a1\'a7\uc0\u20937 \'b5\'e6\'a1\'a8 - \'a5\'7c\'a9\'75\'a8\'a7 is nice(b)\'a1\'6d\'c3\'c9\'af\'bb\'a4\'70\u31548 \'a5\'5d\'a1\'6e\'a1\'41 \'a1\'6d\u34430 \'a4\'af\u28903 \u21334 \'a1\'6e- tastes good(c)\'a1\'6d\'b3\'4a\'aa\'a3\u39277  Egg Fried Rice\'a1\'6eis a little blend.- their staff service attitude is better than our own.- one local taxi driver told us to go to \'a1\'6d\'a5\'c3\'b1\'64\'b5\'f3, \'ab\'48\u20041 \'b8\'f4-\'b9\'a9\'ae\'f5\'a4\'a5\'a1\'6eto try their \'a1\'6d\'a4\'70\u31548 \'a5\'5d\'a1\'6e.\",,,,,,2014/10/28," It was not my first Din Tai Fun, I wasn't even going to go in cus the wait was loooongg.

And you come back in 20-30 min - voila - you are called! Also your order is entered in the computer prior to you sitting down. They give you a box thing to put your purses/jacket and they cover that. Definitely try their signature Shio long bao - and pan fried gyoza. Soooo good. Even the fried rice I can't pick fault. Their braised beef noodle soup is also top flavour, do not miss that. This place never ceases to surprise me doesn't matter how many times I refuse to go in because the long wait. Service excellent inside and outside - they don't bang their dishes, everything was quietly and carefully placed on your table. They speak to you in full sentences and they nod or bow their heads to acknowledge. They have a fleet of welcome staff(trainees) at the front - you cannot be pampered enough!

It was very good so I was excited to find the one at the Taipei 101 building on our trip to Taiwan. We went up to the top of the tower and tried to get down to the restaurant before it opened at 11am, however the long lines at the elevator made us a little late. We had a party of five and the wait was about 30 minutes, parties of two went pretty quickly.I think I went a little crazy ordering while waiting for our number to be called. We had enough food for at least seven or eight people, but it was all so good. I'm not sure if the menu was exactly the same as in California, I ordered the wrong dumplings, but the vegetable and pork dumplings were good, just not as good as the pork only dumplings. The noodles with pork and tofu were excellent, as well as the chicken dumplings and the cucumbers.As we were leaving, the wait was over an hour, so do yourself a favor and go at opening. Every minute after that will make the wait longer and longer. But don't skip this place if you haven't had it before, it will be worth the wait.\",,,,,,,2014/10/24, I would not recommend this place for those who do not have much time in Taipei. It takes normally at least 35 - 45 minutes for the customer to find a table in the restaurant.Given the fact that the food is so good. They have amazing dumbling . The skin is soft juicy. \,,,,,,,2014/10/22," Two people of us waited for 90 minutes and the food and service compensated for our waiting.

Luckily we came earlier so there were no queue. There are even 6 private rooms in the restaurants. Service was fast and the waitresses were attentive and accommodating. When seated, the waitress gave us the menus and served us tea and also provided a storage crate for us to put our belonging in there.Din Tai Fung serves a wide variety of dishes, ranges from dumplings, noodles (fried noodles or soup noodles such as wonton soup noodles), appetizer, bun (sweet or savoury), to desserts.With no clue what is good, I\'a1\'a6ve ordered"," Xiaolongbao (x10 per order), beef noodle soup, Pork and Glutinous Rice Shaomai, Prawn Pan-fried Dumplings and Fried Tofu Rice Noodles. After finished ordering, the waitress provided us some shredded ginger on the table and you can eat it with the Xiaolongbao (or anything you want to eat it with).For being living in South Africa, there are hardly any chances to eat delicate Chinese cuisine. But I have to admit these are awesome dumplings! Small, shredded tender pork, with a hint of sesame oil. It is juicy and soft with perfectly thin dough (their signature Golden 18 folds \'a9\'db\'b5\'50\'b6\'c0\'aa\'f718\'ba\'50) and it didn\'a1\'a6t break when picking it out of the steamer. Once you popped it into your mouth the sauce just bursts. AMAZEBALLS! Definitely by far, my favourite one for the meal. And also try to add a hint of vinegar, ginger and soy sauce, the flavoring is quite awesome too! (Just to make a note, don\'a1\'a6t mistaken Xiaolongtunbao \'a4\'70\'c5\'a2\'b4\'f6\'a5\'5d as Xiaolongbao, which is only available before noon, comes with broth and it is smaller than the Xiaolongbao.)I\'a1\'a6ve also tried the braised beef noodle soup, the beef is tender and the broth is light. But I don\'a1\'a6 t really like thin noodles plus I had better beef noodle soup else where.My second favourite is the Prawn Pan-fried Dumplings. They are well pan-fried and the dough is crispy and not greasy at all. It is filled with tender and juicy pork mince and fresh prawns.We\'a1\'a6ve also tried the Pork and Glutinous Rice Shaomai (\'c4\'7a\'a6\'d7\'bf\'4e\'bd\'e6), I was curious about the name of the dish, since I\'a1\'a6ve never heard of it. Bad idea. Not my favourite at all. There are way too much glutinous rice in proportion to the dough and the meat.I like that they have a clear window to the kitchen in front of the restaurant to display how the chefs make their steamed pork dumplings. Not sure if it is intended for entertainment purposes but I think it is a way Din Tai Fung want to show their visitors the quality of the restaurant, that everything is freshly made. But poor chefs, they reminds me of Oompa-Loompas from the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\'a1\'a6s, they are like the little machines!Although the price is relatively higher than other restaurants with the same type of cuisine, but you pay for what you get.

I salute them for how they do it! The waitresses were attentive, polite and kind that it made the dining experience there a whole lot more than just about food. Love the little bag carrier that they put next to your table so that you can put your bags in - that was cool.\",,,,,,,2014/6/9, Yes this place is excellent. Went to this location and the original. Most organized and efficiently run restaurant ever! On top of that the food is amazing!!! Soup dumplings are out of this world and so is everything else! Not to miss! \,,,,,,,2014/6/9," Some of the BEST dim sum i have ever had... They said it would be a 30 minute wait; it was about an hour. I would have waited two hours had I known how good it was going to be. Flawless service, and a bit of a show (Between them making the food in the glassed-in kitchen, and the Korean celebrity who came in with her entourage -- No idea who it was), it was quite an evening.\",,,,,,,2014/6/5," Doesn't matter which location you visit, this will be one of the most heavenly meals to ever grace your lips. Expect a wait, but the wait will be worth it! In most cases the time is spot on, so get your number, take a walk around, and come back at time to get your table. Each order is made when you place it, so everything is fresh, and amazing. You can watch the men make dumplings while you are waiting. It's entertaining and interesting to see how they are made. I travel a great deal, and this is one of my favorite places to eat on the planet, so don't miss it while you're in Taipei! \",,,,,,,2014/6/5," You must try it and you won't regret.

Not unlike an American chain restaurant, their quality, the presentation and the taste is the same all over the world. At the 101 location I did, however, experience the longest waiting time until we were seated. Over 90 minutes.

If I have the chance will definitely be back!\",,,,,,,2014/3/8," As always, Din Tai Fung is crowded, with long lines and some wait time. But the staff are efficient, friendly and service is pretty fast. Their dumplings and xiao lung pao are just absolutely delicious. Thin and delicate warppers, pretty substantial fillings, and great sauces to complement the dumplings. Food heaven. We arrived around 11 am, and was able to be seated immediately. If one arrives after11 am and the restaurant is full, just get a number and take time to walk around while waiting to be called. The best time to go is in midafternoon, after a heavy breakfast, to serve as a light late lunch since the dumplings are really not filling enough to satisfy for lunch unless one orders the other things on their menu. Our taxi drivers recommend the main store( supposedly the dumplings taste better there, but if the line is long- which is all the time, one waits on the streets rather than have a nice place to browse in Taipei 101). A must try place when in Taipei. ( I have also eaten at their Shanghai branch).\",,,,,,,2014/3/8," Love this place! When you dont speak the language, it can be a bit daunting but just roll with it because it is loads of fun and great food. Be sure to check out the guys making the dumplings - how cool are they?

Experienced, friendly, polite and well trained personel.Foreigner living in Taipei last 5 years, beleive it or not its a place to visit even if you are here only for 2 days.\",,,,,,,2014/3/11," As we knew that this place would be crowded, we picked a in between meal time (4pm), and got a seat in about 10min time. the dumplings are great, definitely a must try. however, also try out their small dishes, as they are equally as good.\",,,,,,,2014/3/11, Din Tai Fung is a true leader in dumplings. Their stir fried vegetables are great as well. My whole family loves this restaurant! We also go to the Sogo Tienmu location.\,,,,,,,2014/3/8," Was taken here by a colleague who was trying to convince me that the real food of Taiwan was better than what I had been having and he was most definitely right. Fantastic textures on the food, great flavors and the service was excellent! If I have the chance will definitely be back!\",,,,,,,2014/3/8," As always, Din Tai Fung is crowded, with long lines and some wait time. But the staff are efficient, friendly and service is pretty fast. Their dumplings and xiao lung pao are just absolutely delicious. Thin and delicate warppers, pretty substantial fillings, and great sauces to complement the dumplings. Food heaven. We arrived around 11 am, and was able to be seated immediately. If one arrives after11 am and the restaurant is full, just get a number and take time to walk around while waiting to be called. The best time to go is in midafternoon, after a heavy breakfast, to serve as a light late lunch since the dumplings are really not filling enough to satisfy for lunch unless one orders the other things on their menu. Our taxi drivers recommend the main store( supposedly the dumplings taste better there, but if the line is long- which is all the time, one waits on the streets rather than have a nice place to browse in Taipei 101). A must try place when in Taipei. ( I have also eaten at their Shanghai branch).\",,,,,,,2014/3/8," Love this place! When you dont speak the language, it can be a bit daunting but just roll with it because it is loads of fun and great food. Be sure to check out the guys making the dumplings - how cool are they? The line moves fast so dont let that put you off, it is worth the wait - yum, yum!!\",,,,,,,2014/3/7," The best soup dumplings i've ever eaten. I've been to other branches in Taipei and Sydney which were amazing too, but the 101 restaurant was probably the best overall experience.\",,,,,,,2014/3/3," Was dining at this restaurant on December. The dumpling was good, taste better than the one served in Singapore. No porky smell & the meat no frozen taste. Had the fried rice too, the rice is like pearl, glossy n shiny. Texture just right. Yummy. Sure will go again if I go Taiwan. Value for money.\",,,,,,,2014/3/2," If you are even near this part of the world, you must have Din Tai Fung. The food is beyond good, the service is wonderful and the food, the food, the food. Also, you should try the food. Really.\",,,,,,,2014/3/2," Din Tai Fung in Taipei always impress me. I always go to Danhua branch very time I'm in town. The food is great, eapecially the famous Sao Loung Pao. Highly recommended!\",,,,,,,2014/2/27," I always love Din Tai Fung and to be able to dine in Din Tai Fung (Taipei) was really a very good experience. This branch was extremely crowded when I went and the Queue was really long. As always, we were given an order chit to write our orders and we obtained a Queue number in a very orderly manner. The staff that attended to us was very courteous and helpful despite the crowd. She explained to us that a particular food item we were looking for is not available in the Taipei Menu (we had that in Singapore) and told us to try alternative. We asked her how long do we have to wait for our Queue number to be call and she estimated 40 minutes. We went for a walk and came back exactly 40 minutes and true enough our number was called. We sat down and food came in about 5 minutes. Food was great and it was a great experience eating at Taipei 101.\",,,,,,,2014/2/27," Who would ever think a humble dumpling would garner a Michelin star?This restaurant was packed with people waiting to get in and with people dining. While waiting, you could view chefs making the steamed xiao long bao/soup dumplings. Its a 3 month apprenticeship learning how to make the skin and create the dumpling with 18 perfect pleats. Be sure you have the waiter teach you how to eat this morsel, or read the directions, otherwise you'll burn your tongue biting into this juicy, delicious dumpling. In addition to the signature xiao long bao, they have many other steamed dumplings.

Although we have it in Sg, it was always good to taste the authentic main branch. Their service was prompt and polite. The waiting time to the seating was about 10mins which was relatively short for peak dining hour. To my liking, the food seems to be less oily and salty compared to Sg. Their minced pork bean paste noodle is relatively yummy and their xiao long bao is a must a try. Overall, it is definitely one of the restaurants you can try while you are in taiwan.\",,,,,,,2014/2/9, We were looking for a place to pass time while waiting for time to head to the airport.

It is by far the best dumpling I have ever eaten. Simply a must try! The service is wonderful.

Located in the food court on the basement, it bears all the features of a casual and fast-food outlet; but with an impressive modern and customer-oriented management.We waited over half-an-hour to be seated,and ordered, of course, their signatory delicacy of Xiao Long Bao (meat dumpling) and various other types of dumplings as well as the traditional soup noodles with pork chop and stewed beef. All were well prepared and mouth-watering to live up to its renowned reputation.All the food items were quick to serve but, notwithstanding the long waiting queue, customers were allowed to enjoy the food at leisure and never pressed to settle the bill.

I first ventured to Hang zhou Xiaolong Bao, then I lined up for 20 minutes at the Ding Tai Fung. I have always shunned the Ding Tai Fung, as I heard it was the equivalent of a Tourist trap. Today, I decided to put aside my prejudices and give the food a try. Now since this review will be a bit biting, I will say some good things first. The environment is very nice. It gives off the vibe that it is well maintained and well managed despite being so incredibly busy. Secondly, the staff is incredibly courteous and extremely efficient as well. Since Ding Tai Fung is frequented by tourists, their staff members willing help outsiders understand the menu. The service and environment really deserve an A+.Now, comes the not so good part. Firstly, I was shocked at the value of the Xiaolong Bao and Dumplings. The whole order came out to be over 400 dollars. Keep in mind, one can get the same dishes at Hang Zhou Xiaolongbao for $290. But, I thought to myself, ""This is okay, After all, they are in 101 and rent is not cheap."". But, boy was I disappointed. My cousin who came here once said, ""Ding Tai Fung is not even better than Joe Shanghai's."" and I will say my cousin was wrong, because it is in reality worse than Joe Shanghai's. Although the juice from the buns was pretty good, the meat from the buns tasted like cardboard and was utterly dry. Secondly, the skin of the dumplings tasted like paper and didn't have that fresh bite to it. Thirdly, these buns did not even have a lot of meat. The same could be said about the dumplings as well. I can see how people would think this place was great if it was their first experience in a dumpling and bun establishment, but a 20 minute wait(and that's only for one person, imagine how long a party 5 would be), steam buns for the cost of two dishes in other places, and then eating food which was more or less paper on the outside with tiny cardboard on the inside is really not worth it.

I would not come back for the food, but the service and the overall atmosphere makes this place nice for social gatherings, and it is extremely clean.\",,,,,,,2013/12/30, great food...

I was unfamiliar with the locale and the restaurant, but was happy with our wait and the table. I did try the truffled pork dumplings, and was told not to dip them in the lemongrass/vinegar/soy sauce after I did it to the first.

Visited it twice in one week, the first time with our Taiwanese hosts and then on our own. The first time, our Taiwanese host ordered for us and when we returned on our own, the staff were wonderful and guided us in making our selections. We had fun, the food was delicious, every single bite of it! Great to see the chefs in action and they were very willing to pose for photos and hostess gave us a full rundown on chefs' training and what they were baking. The first time we visited our host had reservations and there was n wait. The second time we were advised that there was a 40 minute wait but it turned out to be only 20 minutes.

A long line and numbers flashing on a board to indicate who could now be seated showed the popularity of the 101 branch. Its mall location, however, means the opportunity to shop rather than standing "" forever"" in a queue. The hostess told us it would be about 40 minutes until we could be seated. We returned 35 minutes later, just as our number started to flash on the board. Inside, a friendly waitperson led us to our table in the brightly lit cavernous space. En route, we passed a glassed-in preparation area, where chefs prepared the famous Xiao Long Bao dumplings by pounding, kneading, wrapping, folding and steaming. I thought a prominent sign in that area (""Bestowed with 1 Michelin star"") to be misleading. According to information I read later, it is the Hong Kong branch that holds this designation.We found the dumplings and other items we ate at this branch to be between average and very good but not even close to what one would expect from a Michelin-rated establishment. The Xiao Long Bao star of truffles and pork proved to be OK, not great, and pricey at 450 NT$ for five.

I proceeded to din tai fung at taipei 101 on a Sunday about 4pm. The queue was crazy long but I guess that makes good marketing. I decided to do the take away route which the staff said will take 12-15 minutes for the xiao lung pao I ordered. That's ok... When I got the take out, immediately proceeded to the food court next to it and go a seat to eat. The xiao lung pao was cold. It should be taken hot as the juices inside are very nice when hot. A bit disappointing although it still tastes quute good.But if you have tried the xiao lung pao at ding tai fung elsewhere, this didnt taste much special.

The whole dining experience was very comfortable. The Xiao long boa was the best of we ever tasted. But other dishes are not as good. Over all this place is worth to visit. Only thing I couldn't understand is why they don't take credit card. My son was visited this place in Octorber this year. Because he lose his ATM card in Tai airpot. He went without cash.

We waited for 30 minutes, just as the sign said, and we were ushered to our table. The decor is moderately-designed, offering an easy atmosphere to sample such famous Chinese cuisines. We ordered 2 different kinds of dumplings, one the most popular, the other sponge gourd and shrimps with shells removed.

We actually had already eaten a full meal at the Xinyi Rd location earlier in the week and so were just stopping in for a quick fix of xiao long bao on a tight schedule. It was 5 pm and we were still in and out in 20 minutes (our choice). 3) You could stay much longer and eat in a more relaxed way if you wanted to. The service is very friendly and courteous. The room is very stylish and it's fun to watch the swarm of people making dumplings through the glass window to the kitchen. At this location they even had a western maitre d' who came to tables occupied by obvious foreigners and offered instructions in English, Spanish, and Polish on how to make the dipping sauce (three parts vinegar to one part soy sauce) and which xiao long bao get sauce and which do not. 4) Try the crab roe & pork xiao long bao instead of the traditional pork ones. Crab roe is awesome. The sauteed fern sprouts looked excellent---I regret not having tried that!\",,,,,,,2013/11/19," It's amazing there are many people queue up when we arrived at 11am.

However, this was not to be the case. When I approached one of the restaurant attendants, she gave me a menu and asked me to take a seat and wait. Within minutes, another attendant collected us and ushered us through the front part of the restaurant, to an area where there was still a lot of available seating. Both attendants spoke fluent English. Once seated, we were approached by an extremely helpful English speaking waiter who advised us that all of their dumplings contained small amounts of MSG, but that he could ensure that MSG was left out of any vegetable dishes that we ordered. We were happy with that, and allowed him to select our dishes for us. Everything, and in particular the xia long bao, was delicious. And the service was exceptional, which added to the experience.

Need I say more? We visited the Din Tai Fung at 101 and were impressed to see how tourist friendly the restaurant and staff were. For those who are just being exposed to dumplings, etc, this is a great place to start as the staff direct you on what to order and how to eat the food. For the inexperienced and experienced, the food is excellent! DTF is a must go anywhere they have a franchise!\",,,,,,,2013/7/25," We came to the restaurant on Sunday last weekend. The place was so crowded, and we had to queue around 30-40 mins. But since it was one of the highlights to our itinerary, then we don't mind to wait at all (there are many shops to look around at Taipei 101, just don't forget your number and come back earlier before the estimated queue time).And after we sat down and chose the menus with the help of friendly and helpful waiters, surprisingly the foods came so fast! Top notch service!!! Thus, we didn't need to wait another time after a long queue ",")We ordered (of course) the famous xiao long bao, and other dumplings, fried rice, beef noodles, etc.All of them tasted great!!! The thickness of the XLB's flour is so perfect. Not too thin, and not too thick! The beefs on beef noodles is so tender! Other dumplings and fried rice also tasted very appetizing!!For the atmosphere, we can't demand a quite and peaceful restaurant. And we think it was reasonable enough though. For those who is going to eat at this restaurant, you have to keep this in mind "," it is the famous Din Tai Fung!! It will be always crowded and packed with tourists, families, etc. Who doesn't tempt to try their yummy dumplings?!

We spent 1 week in Hong Kong and 5 days in Taiwan.We've visited Hong Kong several times before and this was the first time we visited Taiwan and we joined a tour. The tour started in Kiaosuing, travelled up to Taichung and ended in Taipei.On our penultimate night in Taipei, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt Hotel which was just opposite the 101 building. The tour guide recommended that we should try the Din Tai Fung at the 101 building Taipei only..........and we were not disappointed!We had a bad experience at the Din Tai Fung Restaurant in Tsim Sha Shui in Hong Kong. But we trusted the tour guide's recommendation who said this we should try out this Din Tai Fung. At around 8","30pm my wife and I went to the 101 building to find the Din Tai Fung Restaurant. The restaurant is located in the lower ground floor area food court of the 101 building. Yes, there was a long queue.....even at that time of day. But we joined a queue to be allocated a ticket by one of the staff behind the counter. There is a big TV screen outside the entrance of the restaurant which displayed the ticket numbers and the next in line ticket is called out via a speaker system. Very organised indeed. We had to wait approximately 25minutes before our number came up.When our ticket number was called, we went to the front counter and a smiling waitress came to greet us. She took us to our table and said she would be serving us that evening.My wife and I were bowled over by the waitress' warm welcome and genuine friendliness. She really seem to enjoy working at this branch of Din Tai Fung.We ordered Chinese tea, which arrived promptly and served hot (in some restaurant they serve their tea warm.....making the tea tasteless)!We ordered the pork xiao long bao (10 dumplings per set), crab meat xiao long bao (10 dumpling per set), pan fried pork dumplings (6 per portion), a bowl of beef brisket noodles, steamed Chinese chive buns (4 per portion) and a portion of deep fried 'pancake' roll.....I cannot remember what it was but it is in one of the photos that I have loaded up.Everything that we ordered was delicious and we ate everything! The Xiao long bao were especially good. Piping hot and with just the right amount of soup filling and pork filling.........dab it into the red vinegar with finely chopped ginger....................enjoy!!!The foods were all served fresh and hot by happy and attentive staff. This branch is truly a gem of a restaurant if you want to eat xiao long bao and other similar type of regional cuisine dishes. This is the place to come. It is a little expensive but it is worth it!I have no hesitation in recommending this establishment if you come to Taipei!\",,,,,,2013/6/26, On my last full day of business in Taipei my hosts were keen to arrange our work programme to leave time to get down to lunch for 11,"45 sharp. I was bemused. We left out offices halfway up the Taipei 101 skyscraper building and joined the bustling crowds at the front of the Din Tai Fung restaurant in the same building. The place was clearly very popular. Right in the middle of the restaurant you can watch the uniformed chefs behind plate glass working en masse and at great speed to produce the Dim Sum for steaming. Tom Cruise had recently visited the same place whilst filming his latest endeavour and there were many photos of him grinning as he tried his hand at preparing the Dim Sum. The meal itself was a culinary adventure. I just let my hosts order, trying not to ask too many questions about what I was eating and got stuck in. The classic Taiwanese beef noodles were excellent - I even found myself trying the big bits of beef cartilage which we don't often think about eating in Western restaurants. The sticky rice desserts were also delicious and the whole meal was washed down with tea.

What\'a1\'a6s not to like?Despite the immense number of customers, Din Tai Fung\'a1\'a6s service is fast and very Disney-good, and its food lives up to its fame. The xiaolongbao was special in that it tasted hot and aromatically fresh with the `juices\'a1\'a6 inside flowing out to the tongue as we took a bite. It\'a1\'a6s best to gently pick up so the very delicate skin of the dumpling is not broken causing the `juices\'a1\'a6 to drain out. The taste? It\'a1\'a6s like a party in my mouth. It\'a1\'a6s unbelievable!Queues are sometimes part and parcel of a good dining experience. Here, they tell you roughly how long the wait is.

We ordered Beef noodle soup- Taiwan\'a1\'a6s specialty, Wanton soup, Hot and Sour Soup and their famous dumplings. The waiters and waitresses were very efficient.

Indeed, it was much more awesome eating at the country where Din Tai Fung originated!It was a long queue when we arrived, but the waitresses attended to us and gave us the seats first. We were not sure of the reason, but probably cos they knew we were foreigners, and we noticed that they would offer the seats to foreigners first, despite of the long queue with locals. I thought that that was great service, giving foreigners the priority.Ordered fried rice and noodles and the food were yummy, so much yummier than what I eaten at Din Tai Fung back in my country. Was fairly surprised that they have appetizers, as my country did not have it. And of course, we ordered the dumplings, Xiao Long Bao, and it was scrumptious! Besides that, we also ordered vegetable dumplings and it tasted great too! Apart from the delicious food that were cooked to near perfection, the service there was prompt and efficient, the staff were very friendly too. Kudos to the staff!\",,,,,,,2013/4/7," Not much to add to other reviews, just to confirm the excellence. The drill is to wait in long queue (which moves pretty fast), and then enjoy all the amazing dumplings you can, with xiao long bao at the top of the list.\",,,,,,,2013/4/6," So very, very good. The restaurant, in the bottom of the Taipei 101 mall, is 100% worth the visit. Do not be put off by the food court feel, because it is yummo.

One of the best Xiao Long Bao that I ever had.

Very organized - even if there is a wait, it will go quickly. Take time to look at the menu and write down on the paper they hand you the appropriate number of the food you wish. Efficient and they continually check to see if your food is delivered to you hot and fresh. I'm ready to go to their other locations. We bought the chop sticks, wish we could take the food home too.\",,,,,,,2013/4/2, Order while you wait great dumplings my favorite spicy noodles with peanut sauce. The hot and spicy soup is great. Quick service and great food. The staff will help if you are not familiar with food.\,,,,,,,2013/4/1," When you are in Taipei, you simply must check out Din Tain Fung for lunch or dinner. The dumplings (shrimp and pork) are, without a doubt, the best I've ever had. The vegetable wonton soup was also excellent. The restaurant itself is huge, but arranged so well that it doesn't feel crowded. Also, it is great fun to watch the dumpling artisans prepare the food through the large glass windows. A real treat, at a great price.\",,,,,,,2013/3/31," Not much to say, except amazingly awesome! Co-workers took me here for dinner and I was not expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised.

Had we been in Taipei everyday, Din Tai Fung would have been my dinner spot each day!\",,,,,,,2013/3/29," I came here at the behest of Mrs Me, I really had to expectations of how good it would be apart from what the missus was telling me. Surprisingly I had a great time there and their main dumplings were fantastic. The price overall was high for what it was (not complaining though) but it really was a good feed.Also, the issue of lines is true, we got there a but early and pretty much walked in but come ~7-8pm when we got out there were about a dozen waiting to go it (and it's a really big place)\",,,,,,,2013/4/9," We were glad to discover Taipei\'a1\'a6s number 1 rated restaurant at the basement of Taipei. We ordered Beef noodle soup- Taiwan\'a1\'a6s specialty, Wanton soup, Hot and Sour Soup and their famous dumplings. The waiters and waitresses were very efficient. The restaurant ambiance was bright but relaxed and conducive for dinner. Prices were a little higher compared to the stalls on the foodcourt, where we almost ate. But the food quality, service and ambiance plus the free tea made up for it.\",,,,,,,2013/4/9," Although there are many Din Tai Fung restaurants from where I come from, we still went to try it in Taipei as we heard from many friends saying that it is a must try in Taipei, and it will be a different experience. Indeed, it was much more awesome eating at the country where Din Tai Fung originated!It was a long queue when we arrived, but the waitresses attended to us and gave us the seats first. We were not sure of the reason, but probably cos they knew we were foreigners, and we noticed that they would offer the seats to foreigners first, despite of the long queue with locals. I thought that that was great service, giving foreigners the priority.Ordered fried rice and noodles and the food were yummy, so much yummier than what I eaten at Din Tai Fung back in my country. Was fairly surprised that they have appetizers, as my country did not have it. And of course, we ordered the dumplings, Xiao Long Bao, and it was scrumptious! Besides that, we also ordered vegetable dumplings and it tasted great too! Apart from the delicious food that were cooked to near perfection, the service there was prompt and efficient, the staff were very friendly too. Kudos to the staff!\",,,,,,,2013/4/7," Not much to add to other reviews, just to confirm the excellence. The drill is to wait in long queue (which moves pretty fast), and then enjoy all the amazing dumplings you can, with xiao long bao at the top of the list.\",,,,,,,2013/4/6," So very, very good. The restaurant, in the bottom of the Taipei 101 mall, is 100% worth the visit. Do not be put off by the food court feel, because it is yummo. It has a fantastic viewing station so you can watch in adoration as your dumplings are made. Enjoy!\",,,,,,,2013/4/4, A must try place if you are visiting Taipei! One of the best Xiao Long Bao that I ever had. Service was prompt and great too.\,,,,,,,2013/4/4," Very clean, red bean dessert yummmmie - takes like red velvet chocolate!Their vegetables, spinachs, cabbages, are clean and fresh. Very organized - even if there is a wait, it will go quickly. Take time to look at the menu and write down on the paper they hand you the appropriate number of the food you wish. Efficient and they continually check to see if your food is delivered to you hot and fresh. I'm ready to go to their other locations. We bought the chop sticks, wish we could take the food home too.\",,,,,,,2013/4/2, Order while you wait great dumplings my favorite spicy noodles with peanut sauce. The hot and spicy soup is great. Quick service and great food. The staff will help if you are not familiar with food.\,,,,,,,2013/4/1," When you are in Taipei, you simply must check out Din Tain Fung for lunch or dinner. The dumplings (shrimp and pork) are, without a doubt, the best I've ever had. The vegetable wonton soup was also excellent. The restaurant itself is huge, but arranged so well that it doesn't feel crowded. Also, it is great fun to watch the dumpling artisans prepare the food through the large glass windows. A real treat, at a great price.\",,,,,,,2013/3/31," Not much to say, except amazingly awesome! Co-workers took me here for dinner and I was not expecting much, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Apparently I love dumplings of all kinds. Nice that service is al a carte which makes it easy to share mix and match. Service was great and would highly suggest any fellow travelers visiting. Had we been in Taipei everyday, Din Tai Fung would have been my dinner spot each day!\",,,,,,,2013/3/29," I came here at the behest of Mrs Me, I really had to expectations of how good it would be apart from what the missus was telling me.

At 4","30 pm there was no wait and we were seated within minutes. We were given menus in English and given instructions how to order by checking off what you want on the order slip. If you\'a1\'a6re not sure what you want, just select a variety of their signature dishes but you must have the signature pork XiaoLongBao dumplings. A side note \'a1\'56 we were told that the chefs experimented with different variations but the best is each dumpling weighs exactly 21 grams and has 18 folds. The shrimp and pork potstickers were a favorite and so were the sesame and taro buns. All the staff speaks English and are very helpful in assisting with your order, showing you how to properly eat, refilling your tea, clearing plates, timing your orders so your table is never empty and your desert comes at the end. We were seated right in front of the window into the kitchen and it was very interesting watching them make the dumplings. The bill for our family of 4 came to 1500 NT$. Do not miss this great dining experience-we had a lot of fun.\",,,,,,2013/1/20," Fun atmosphere with green tea pouring in my cup after each sip.

I gave full authority of ordering to my partner as they were locals n frequent to the place.One after another around 10 different dihes came in 5 types of dumplings, 3 types of rice and the crispy fried packet (one of which is uploaded in pics by another viewer)Normally am not a fan of Chinese Cusine but this was best ever experience, I ate like monster that evening......my stomach was full but heart still wanted more.Their signature dish is this liquid filled dumpling, this hot soupy liquid ooez out of the dumpling as you puncher it in your mount. Absolutely fantastic cuillinary experince.Will be visiting this place in every Taipei visit.\",,,,,,,2013/1/18," Having tried Din Tai Fung in Singapore before, we definitely took the chance to come down to this outlet at Taipei 101 when we were in Taiwan last December to see if there were any significant differences, since Din Tai Fung originated from Taiwan itself before expanding elsewhere in recent years.And my verdict? I would say the food served is more or less consistently of the same standard, but the service given by the staff are even better than what we had experienced in Singapore. When we entered the restaurant after about an hour's wait due to the long queues, the waiter helped us to cover our belongings with a white cloth. They also helped us to take a picture for us together without even us asking. Very excellent service indeed.As for the food, the dumplings (xiaolongbao) is a must-try, as this is their signature dish. The beef noodle and fried rice are also highly recommended as well. You can get to see the chefs at work while you eat since the kitchen can be seen through transparent glass panels.

Try the Pork Xiaolongbao, Hot and Spicy Wonton's, Shrimp Shomai, House steamed beef, and the Shrimp Fried Rice. Don't forget to wash it down with a large bottle of Taiwan Beer. This branch of DTF is the largest in Taipei, and I found it was the fastest to get seated. The branch at SOGO, while smaller, also has a reasonable wait time, and serves the same great food. I have been to DIn Tai Fung at Xintiandi in Shanghai, and three branches in Taiwan, as well as the two in Hong Kong, and I can say that my favorite is the Taipei 101 branch, as it is unpretentious, and offers great tasting food. \",,,,,,,2013/1/28," Din Tai Fung is one of those restaurants that should be on every travel itinerary for Taiwan. The food is great, the service is excellent and it's relatively inexpensive when you stop to consider that it's been given one Michelin star. The restaurant was founded in Taipei in the 1980s and it's now famous around the world for it's perfectly folded xiaolongbao and dumplings. The glass windows allow diners to see how food is made to perfection. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so make sure you go a bit early. Things work like clockwork within, with most diners eating and leaving within an hour thanks to the speedy and efficient service.\",,,,,,,2013/1/27," Great food, flawless service! The pork dumplings are addictive. My boyfriend loved the shrimp and pork wontons. Going back tonight!\",,,,,,,2013/1/21," After exploring Taipei 101 mall and observatory deck, we headed to the basement food area and easily found Din Tai Fung. At 4","30 pm there was no wait and we were seated within minutes. We were given menus in English and given instructions how to order by checking off what you want on the order slip. If you\'a1\'a6re not sure what you want, just select a variety of their signature dishes but you must have the signature pork XiaoLongBao dumplings. A side note \'a1\'56 we were told that the chefs experimented with different variations but the best is each dumpling weighs exactly 21 grams and has 18 folds. The shrimp and pork potstickers were a favorite and so were the sesame and taro buns. All the staff speaks English and are very helpful in assisting with your order, showing you how to properly eat, refilling your tea, clearing plates, timing your orders so your table is never empty and your desert comes at the end. We were seated right in front of the window into the kitchen and it was very interesting watching them make the dumplings. The bill for our family of 4 came to 1500 NT$. Do not miss this great dining experience-we had a lot of fun.\",,,,,,2013/1/20," Fun atmosphere with green tea pouring in my cup after each sip. The girls working were eager o help with menu selections and anything else you may need. Clean, clean, clean restaurant. Enjoyed the dumplings and the beef noodle soup. I just might look them up in Seattle!\",,,,,,,2013/1/20," I was on a business trip, my partner and his wife suggested to show me Taipei 101 and said they'll make me eat best dumplings of my life.We arrived at the place as per the booking made. We were seated at the place and 1st thing came was obviously the hot green tea. I gave full authority of ordering to my partner as they were locals n frequent to the place.One after another around 10 different dihes came in 5 types of dumplings, 3 types of rice and the crispy fried packet (one of which is uploaded in pics by another viewer)Normally am not a fan of Chinese Cusine but this was best ever experience, I ate like monster that evening......my stomach was full but heart still wanted more.Their signature dish is this liquid filled dumpling, this hot soupy liquid ooez out of the dumpling as you puncher it in your mount. Absolutely fantastic cuillinary experince.Will be visiting this place in every Taipei visit.\",,,,,,,2013/1/18," Having tried Din Tai Fung in Singapore before, we definitely took the chance to come down to this outlet at Taipei 101 when we were in Taiwan last December to see if there were any significant differences, since Din Tai Fung originated from Taiwan itself before expanding elsewhere in recent years.And my verdict? I would say the food served is more or less consistently of the same standard, but the service given by the staff are even better than what we had experienced in Singapore. When we entered the restaurant after about an hour's wait due to the long queues, the waiter helped us to cover our belongings with a white cloth. They also helped us to take a picture for us together without even us asking. Very excellent service indeed.As for the food, the dumplings (xiaolongbao) is a must-try, as this is their signature dish. The beef noodle and fried rice are also highly recommended as well. You can get to see the chefs at work while you eat since the kitchen can be seen through transparent glass panels. Be sure to come a bit early or do reservations first since the queue can be rather long on weekends.\",,,,,,,2013/1/18," long queue, full of tourists, situated in the corner of a mall food court...but great restaurant with delicious dumplings.perhaps due to the fact that we queued up quite late we waited less than half an hour before we were shown to our table.their portions are quite substantial so try to order in small quantities to try everything.i believe there are other branches but if you are not familiar with taipei, this branch is the easiest to get to without speaking the local language.a must when in taipei.\",,,,,,,2013/1/11," I am not normally a dumpling fan, but this place changed my mind. I LOVED these dumplings. Accompanies with the sauteed pea shoots and some Tsing Tao beer, I had the most memorable meal ever. The wait for a table was a bit long, because the restaurant is so popular. I can forgive that though, because the service was prompt and excellent. Take a box of the pineapple cakes home with you. They're delicious!\",,,,,,,2013/1/9," You *CANNOT* leave without trying their dumplings!! And if you don't eat pork--eat it ANYWAY because you will not have buns like these ANYWHERE! There are cooks constantly making them, and they don't last--as they finish cooking, their delivered straight to anxious diners.I felt like I was floating away as I was having them--they were perfect! They were the most memorable part of our trip to Taipei!!! Also, try the sesame balls..OH YUM!!!! \",,,,,,,2012/12/30," Din Tai Fung doesn't disappoint!

A definite must for all visitors to Taipei 101!!!\",,,,,,,2012/12/30," This branch of Din Tai Fung at Taipei 101 is huge once you get inside off the food court entrance.

The food is second to none and the service is fabulous. We keep coming back for those pork and shrimp dumplings!\,,,,,,,2012/12/29," Although some travelers might be turned off because this is located in the Taipei 101 Mall adjacent to the food court, it is one of the top 5 places to eat in Taipei, and it is crowded with locals and visitors alike!\",,,,,,,2012/12/28," After spend almost the entire morning at 101 viewing deck with my family of five, it is time for lunch. I decided to have our lunch here as it is raining heavily outside and we don't want to get our-self wet. It is not difficult to find the restaurant even we need to make some detour as there is renovation going on. The queue is long but moving very fast, my waiting time is 15 min or less and we are more or less have our order ready. Upon seated the waitress quickly placed two baskets next to our seat for us to put our belonging and jacket and cover it with a cloth. Without knowing hot tea will be provided as default we ordered a few soft drinks. When we realized hot tea is provided we ask to cancel the soft drink. The waitress promptly remove our order slip and re-print a new one with soft drink removed. The food is excellent as mentioned in many reviews here. My entire family including my 5 yrs old enjoy the food very much.

Make a reservation if you can, because they get packed fast. If you've never eaten the Chinese dumplings before, they give you a card to explain how to do it,, which was great because I had apparently been doing it improperly, and it made sense once I read the card. The wait staff was great, and it was fun watching the chefs prepare the dumplings through the glass.

The best thing about Din Tai Fung in Taipei is that no matter what time, what month you visit, or return, the food is as delicious as it was the last time. But the main thing about this location that makes it better than anyother Din Tai Fung in the world, is the staff. The hostesses alway friendly and there to help you fill out your order. They can tell you nearly to the minute how long you may have to wait for a table. The staff inside are incredibly efficient and friendly. I have never had an empty tea glass here. You simply cannot fault the service at this location. The food is also out of this world. Every xiao long bao is the same size, the same amazing taste, fresh and hot. We have just returned from a short holiday to Hong Kong where we visited the Silvercord branch of Din Tai Fung, and it was awful in comparison to any of Taipei's locations. At the 101 the service is incredible, the value for money is unbelievable, and I think that it is my favourite restaurant. Ever. The beef noodle soup is also good, although in my opinion the dumplings and xiao long bao are to die for.\",,,,,,,2012/12/10, And perhaps someday that will be true.

We were impressed and then some. We got to this location around 4 in the afternoon and there was no line. From what we saw, the service is very efficient. After you are taken to the table, you are handed the menus and a mini-clipboard to indicate what you woild like to order. The servers would then take your menus and the food runners would bring your food out when it is ready.The three of us ordered 3baskets of the 10-piece pork soup dumplings. They brought 2 of the baskets out first, then the last ine after we were done so they would not cool too quickly. There is an info card that tells you how to eat a soup dumpling. One of the waitstaff kindly came by and poured out the ratio of black vinegar to soy sauce over the ginger for us. In addition, we also ordered the beef noodle soup, minced pork noodle, beef tendon soup, and a pork fried rice, and a few side dishes (the house side with seaweed and beancurd, marinated cucumbers, and pickled cabbage). For dessert we had the steamed taro buns.The soup dumplings did not disappoint. They were delicious, and among the best I have had, but I did not see fireworks when I ate them. Hey, they have a Michelin star! However, the MVP was definitely the beef noodle soup, and blew us away! We got the half meat, half tendon option, and it melted in your mouth. It makes sense though, in a country where beef noidle soup is the national dish, that this version would be impeccable. The broth was a good balance of flavors and addictive. The fried rice was well made but on the generic side. The noodles with minced pork was flavorful and satisfying and thus a winner as well. In terms of the sides, the marinated cucumbers were tasty (but I still prefer my mom's version) as was the house side, but skip the very weak and nearly flavorless pickled cabbage. The steamed taro buns were a perfect close of our meal...warm, pillowy soft, and the filling not too sweet.This place is pricier, and some of the items worth the price. Wished that I could have reported that everything we got hit it out of the park. I would gladly come back if anyone suggests coming here.Don't forget to check out the kitchen though. It is amazing watching the skill and efficiency of the kitchen staff work to make the soup dumplings.\",,,,,,,2012/11/19," I loved our first Din Tai Funf experience.

Service also fast and the price isn't that bad. The long queue was worth it. ^^\,,,,,,,2012/11/9, it's located at the basement of taipei 101 and the queue was quite long. we waited for around 15-20 mins before being seated. it was alright as there were shops around for us to shop while waiting. the food was served very quickly and service was good. previously visited the sogo's branch and love the xiao long baos. felt that the soup in xlb there were always better than sg's ,) a must eat whenever in taipei! \,,,,,,2012/11/7, I have dined five times now at the Taipei 101 Branch of Din Tai Fung. The food and service are always excellent as is the modern decor. If going with a group it is best to book. This is enormously popular and very much on the itinerary for the 2 million Mainland tourists visiting Taipei every year. Without a booking you could be in for a very long wait.\,,,,,,,2012/11/1, An excellent lunch in this famous restaurant is remarkably affordable. The menus and service are top notch. Getting there isn't too much trouble. There's a shuttle bus to 101 from the MRT (although I do have to wonder why they didn't build this thing at an MRT station). A meal here should be a high priority for any 3- or 4-day visit to Taipei.\,,,,,,,2012/10/30, Almost every expat in Taipei will tell you they know somewhere which is as good as Din Tai Fung and cheaper... they're lying. Just because this is the most famous doesn't stop it from being the best place to eat xiaolongbao and other dumplings. Some of my favourite dishes are," xiaolongbao, pot stickers, fried rice, pea shoots with garlic, spicy sesame noodles. The Xinyi branch is the original one - the 101 branch is probably the best place to get served quickly as it's the biggest. (I'm posting the same review to both as the quality of the food is the same).\",,,,,,2012/10/29," The hype is to be believed. The lines are crazy but the staff are friendly and everyone is very prompt. They make sure that you go away with a great experience, despite waiting at least 30 minutes for a table. We got our number, were given a menu in advance and it took a while to pick out everything. Maybe come hungry so you don't have to make too many decisions. It's not too pricey considering the quality. Recommend that you splurge on the pork truffle dumplings. It was probably one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life. Don't come for romance - it's all about the speed of food here.\",,,,,,,2012/11/25," Loved watching the dumplings being made. They were only ok taste wise, nothing special.

We were impressed and then some. We got to this location around 4 in the afternoon and there was no line. From what we saw, the service is very efficient. After you are taken to the table, you are handed the menus and a mini-clipboard to indicate what you woild like to order. The servers would then take your menus and the food runners would bring your food out when it is ready.The three of us ordered 3baskets of the 10-piece pork soup dumplings. They brought 2 of the baskets out first, then the last ine after we were done so they would not cool too quickly. There is an info card that tells you how to eat a soup dumpling. One of the waitstaff kindly came by and poured out the ratio of black vinegar to soy sauce over the ginger for us. In addition, we also ordered the beef noodle soup, minced pork noodle, beef tendon soup, and a pork fried rice, and a few side dishes (the house side with seaweed and beancurd, marinated cucumbers, and pickled cabbage). For dessert we had the steamed taro buns.The soup dumplings did not disappoint. They were delicious, and among the best I have had, but I did not see fireworks when I ate them. Hey, they have a Michelin star! However, the MVP was definitely the beef noodle soup, and blew us away! We got the half meat, half tendon option, and it melted in your mouth. It makes sense though, in a country where beef noidle soup is the national dish, that this version would be impeccable. The broth was a good balance of flavors and addictive. The fried rice was well made but on the generic side. The noodles with minced pork was flavorful and satisfying and thus a winner as well. In terms of the sides, the marinated cucumbers were tasty (but I still prefer my mom's version) as was the house side, but skip the very weak and nearly flavorless pickled cabbage. The steamed taro buns were a perfect close of our meal...warm, pillowy soft, and the filling not too sweet.This place is pricier, and some of the items worth the price. Wished that I could have reported that everything we got hit it out of the park. I would gladly come back if anyone suggests coming here.Don't forget to check out the kitchen though. It is amazing watching the skill and efficiency of the kitchen staff work to make the soup dumplings.\",,,,,,,2012/11/19," I loved our first Din Tai Funf experience. Food was excellent, service was good, and the servers were very courteous and nice. Good value\",,,,,,,2012/11/13," Yup, it was really a place to go and visit. we went very early before the lunch crowd arrived so we were able to get seats right away. Had to try the famous xiao long bao dimsum and other yummy fod that they serve. Found it a bit pricey but again this is Din Tai Fung..a must try!\",,,,,,,2012/11/12, I love to eat here since the food taste very good and the waitress are very nice and full of smile. Service also fast and the price isn't that bad. The long queue was worth it. ^^\,,,,,,,2012/11/9, it's located at the basement of taipei 101 and the queue was quite long. we waited for around 15-20 mins before being seated. it was alright as there were shops around for us to shop while waiting. the food was served very quickly and service was good. previously visited the sogo's branch and love the xiao long baos. felt that the soup in xlb there were always better than sg's ,) a must eat whenever in taipei! \,,,,,,2012/11/7, I have dined five times now at the Taipei 101 Branch of Din Tai Fung. The food and service are always excellent as is the modern decor. If going with a group it is best to book. This is enormously popular and very much on the itinerary for the 2 million Mainland tourists visiting Taipei every year. Without a booking you could be in for a very long wait.\,,,,,,,2012/11/1, An excellent lunch in this famous restaurant is remarkably affordable. The menus and service are top notch. Getting there isn't too much trouble. There's a shuttle bus to 101 from the MRT (although I do have to wonder why they didn't build this thing at an MRT station). A meal here should be a high priority for any 3- or 4-day visit to Taipei.\,,,,,,,2012/10/30, Almost every expat in Taipei will tell you they know somewhere which is as good as Din Tai Fung and cheaper... they're lying. Just because this is the most famous doesn't stop it from being the best place to eat xiaolongbao and other dumplings. Some of my favourite dishes are," xiaolongbao, pot stickers, fried rice, pea shoots with garlic, spicy sesame noodles. The Xinyi branch is the original one - the 101 branch is probably the best place to get served quickly as it's the biggest. (I'm posting the same review to both as the quality of the food is the same).\",,,,,,2012/10/29," The hype is to be believed. The lines are crazy but the staff are friendly and everyone is very prompt. They make sure that you go away with a great experience, despite waiting at least 30 minutes for a table. We got our number, were given a menu in advance and it took a while to pick out everything. Maybe come hungry so you don't have to make too many decisions. It's not too pricey considering the quality. Recommend that you splurge on the pork truffle dumplings. It was probably one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life. Don't come for romance - it's all about the speed of food here.\",,,,,,,2012/10/29," I love dumplings, and I am pretty well inclined to like any restaurant that is well known for it's dumplings, but this restaurant really does have some of the best dumplings I've ever eaten. They are absolutely delicious, and considering it's a Michelin star restaurant, the prices are really not bad. 5 of us ate all of the dumplings, hot and sour soup, and rice that we could eat, and with a little beer the cost was only about $70 USD. The staff is really friendly and very attentive. Definitely give this one a visit if you are a dumpling lover.\",,,,,,,2012/10/28," We wanted to come because it was so famous and highly regarded. We also didn't like waiting in long queues. So we checked out the restaurant before going up 101, and found heaps of people already. We got our no, a 45 min wait. So we decided to have a view from the top first, which was quite a leisure. We returned after exactly 45 mins but found that they had called our no. already. The lady there was very nice to arrange us a table if we had our full accompany there already. We checked out the menu while waiting and were seated after 5 mins. While waiting they already asked if we wanted tea or water for our girls. Food was served promptly, with excellent taste and generous portion. We also tried Taipei beer that was soothing. We ordered xiao long bao, shrimp shao mai, pork chop fried rice, pork chop noddles in soup, stir fried shrimp, big pork bun, shrimp wanton in soup, coke and beer. We wanted to order dessert but were too full already. Altogether totaled NTD1700. Not as expensive as read somewhere else.\",,,,,,,2012/10/24," Quality food; good service. Price is fair. I'm not sure if good restaurant service is typical in Taipei, they provide good service without us feeling harrassed.\",,,,,,,2012/10/23," We loved the local food and street food as well. STaff showed and explained some kinds of food, and the meanings as well. There are many street food shop nearby as well. We loved especially Xial Bao Long and its tasty.it got a different taste from other kind of food\",,,,,,,2012/10/18, Food and service are out of this world......I wish I could order every single item from the menu. I went there twice during my 72 hours trip just to cover as much food as I can from their diverse menu\,,,,,,,2012/10/17, You can taste the difference in the quality of food as compared to the ones served in Singapore. Certain dishes are significantly better. the 'Hong You Chao Shou' & 'Xiao Long Bao' are a must-try!\,,,,,,,2012/10/14, Din Tai Fung Xiao Long Bao are world famous and justifiable so. However the rest of the menu is just as good. This location is larger than the other Taipei branches but there can still be a long wait at peak times. The location in the basement food court of Taipei 101 is modern and comfortable with well spaced tables and very professional and helpful service. Definitely worth a visit.\,,,,,,,2012/9/30," My benchmark for Xiao Long Bao is Joe's Shanghai in NYC. And, now I don't know which I like better. I will need to re-evaluate and let you know. The picture menu and numbering system makes it extremely easy for ordering. The wait staff was very helpful. We had a great time. Bonus - there is no waiting at this location.\",,,,,,,2012/9/24," Din Tai Fung is famous for its crowd, especially during lunchtime and dinnertime. I was over at Xinyi branch during lunchtime and I have to pass it because it was simply too crowded. I came over here to 101 at about 3.30pm and there were a few empty tables. So unless you are prepared to wait, go during off peak hours.I ordered the famous XiaoLongBao (pork) and the chicken soup with noodles. They were excellent. They have similar dishes in Singapore and somehow, the food taste extra special when dining at Din Tai Fung in Taiwan.\",,,,,,,2012/9/20," It was so good, the food the service.. Everything!!

Firstly, there is so much choice on the menu that we go back again and again. I love the fish dumplings and the Chicken baos, as they have so much flavour. Having the choice of ordering the shrimp rice with brown rice is also something I love. It is classic Chinese/Taiwanese cuisine at its best. Feels healthy and is so tasty and filling. The service is also above expectations, with staff being very attentive and friendly, which creates an incredible atmosphere. For the overall experience the restaurant is absolutely great value for money. I strongly recommend this Din Tai Fung!\",,,,,,,2012/9/7," We were there as a large group and the service was excellent, the restaurant atmosphere great and more importantly the dumplings were sublime. I can't fault the place at all.\",,,,,,,2012/8/27," I've tried Din Tai Fung in Jakarta, in Singapore, in Kuala Lumpur, and in Shanghai. But this one wins hands down! The food tastes so much better, the xiaolongbao is very juicy, you can order your fried rice made from brown rice (if you are more health concious), the portion is also larger, and the food comes out from the kitchen in nice sequence. First the appetizer, then the soup, then the xiaolongbao, then the other side dishes we ordered, and last but not least the dessert. One thing that sets this restaurant apart from all the Din Tai Fung joints I have visited is the staff. I don't know whether it's particularly just the staff from this branch or Taiwanese in general, but they are all soooooo nice. So cheery and smiley. Constantly topping out our beer, checking whether our orders have been deliver or not, changing the plates, etc. one staff was very special to us as he personally explained to us the history of Din Tai Fung, how to eat xiaolongbao properly, translated everything for us from mandarin to english. Very impressive! \",,,,,,,2012/8/25," It's always crowded, but don't let that deter you.

It's more spacious than all the rest and is in the mall complex below Taipei 101, making it an easy meal experience after or before the ascend of the second tallest building in the world. Here you can try most of the dumplings in either servings of 5 peices or 10, so if you are alone, like I was, you can taste more than at other branches which only have larger order sizes. Indulge in the foie gras flavored dumplings; they are divine.\",,,,,,,2012/8/17," I and eleven of my colleagues enjoyed a wonderful lunch here after a long week of meetings. We expected a long wait, and good food, but they managed to get us seated rather swiftly, and just before the food began to arrive, one of the waitresses came out and 'instructed' all of us Westerners how to best enjoy the food. I've eaten a fair bit of dim sum in China, and thought I knew what I was doing, but trying it the way she instructed made the experience even better.I have to say, the Taiwan dumplings are much better than those in Beijing. I don't think they set a single thing on our table that wasn't scrumptious. Our tea never got cold, and the staff was constantly checking on us. What an amazing lunch, made even better by the great staff, and then a trip to the observation deck of Taipei 101.\",,,,,,,2012/8/5, The food was simply great.

We never required to ask for our tea to be refilled and the staff were always around making sure that our cups remained full.The service crew does their best to try to answer our queries not only about the menu but also about places of interest around the 101 area and Taipei too. \,,,,,,,2012/6/9," Every year when I come to Taipei, my first steps I'm going to Din Tai Fung. This time I was in 101 branch. For me, as european guy, is very hard to compare to other branches in Taipei (I tried all of them). Service - very good and fast, food - perfect, waiting before entry - same long as everywhere in Taipei. So if you want to try real taiwanese dumplings which are so delicious, you must go to Din tai Fung. Is cheap, fast and delicious - so must to see.\",,,,,,,2012/5/27," A loyal supporter of DTF in Singapore, decided to go try it in Taipei. The 101 branch had a very long queue the fri afternoon I was there. But the girls were all very service oriented and efficient and food came soon after we were seated. Enjoyed the meal!\",,,,,,,2012/5/20," For those who enjoy good food and good dim sum, Din Tai Fung is a definite must. The Din Tai Fung in Taipei 101 was a wonderful experience and a treat to my tummy. Their famed Xiao Long Bao was so juicy and succulent and they even have an open kitchen showing their chefs at work. They also have other house specialties that one should try like the beef soup and the pot stickers.

It is very well known & well liked among Taiwanese and is a classic must do while in Taiwan. It has grown into a large chain across Taiwan & there are several locations in Taipei AKA easy to find. We ordered quite a few dishes for two but def worth it! We had the classic pork dumplings (there's a specific process to eat them, with directions given to us on a little card by our waiter), some noodles, crispy wontons, more dumplings of all kinds and hot&sour soup which was delicious!

Present in different countries, it is known to serve exquisite Xiao Long Paos and Hand Made Noodles. The quality and the flavor of their products is excellent. Must try dishes would be the Xiao Long Paos (any ones with the must try or specialty logo), the tan tan mien or Noodles mixed with broad bean xa (my favorites). Another must try is the dumplings with chilli sauce. The general food quality of the xiao long paos and dumplings in the Taipei branch is slightly better than their Singapore and Shanghai branches. but some of the dishes are slightly underseasoned (less salty) which might be more of the flavor palette of the Taiwanese customers than a failure of the restaurant (observed over a couple of Taiwanese restaurants). The difference though is minor that most won't even notice. The restaurant turnover is very fast so don't worry if you find yourself staying in line for a while. Also the restaurant is very kid friendly. We were with our 2 and a half year old and the staff brought child utensils, high chair and even offered to take pictures of us.

I loved how they gave the ladies a stand up basket to put their purses in and a cloth cover for anyone who had a jacket/coat on their seat back to prevent it from absorbing any food smells. The food came out relatively quickly, and I was soon supping on their perfect xiao long baos, shrimp fried rice, wonton soup, crispy pot stickers, and sauteed Chinese watercress. I also ordered the pork and truffle dumplings, which came with a new set of utensils and plates with orders not to dip it in the traditional soy/vinegar sauce. It's pretty expensive compared to the regular xlb and you only 5 per order, but it was soooooooooo good!\",,,,,,,2011/11/14," This is nice restaurant to have steam dumplings!

After lunch, go up to Taipei 101 to enjoy the view in peace as groups of tourist would hav gone for lunch. \",,,,,,,2011/10/12," Din Tai Fung is located in the Taipei 101 mall, in the basement. (Although in a basement it does have a window onto a courtyard so during the day I would think gets plenty of sunlight). I think it must be quite new because you may find your hotel haven't heard of it. In which case they will try and send you to the original Din Tai Fung, which is not in the Taipei 101 complex - although I understand very good.The restaurant is part of a chain, although perhaps a bit unfair to call it a chain as it is a select few rather than hundreds. The group is originally from Taipei, and you can go to the original one - as per my comment above. As a group they have won many awards including Michelin stars.The restaurant is set at the back of a food court, so you may initially wonder if this is for you, but persevere. The restaurant is very modern, but pleasant and looks scrupulously clean. You will be given a menu with pictures and multi-langauge translations, this may seem a bit downmarket but it really does help if you don't read chinese! You write your order down on what looks like a multiple choice questionnaire.The staff are very friendly and helpful, there is some english spoken here if you need help, but it is pretty self explanatory. Note the speciality is the pork dumplings and you can enjoy the performance theatre of these being made in the glass panelled kitchen. Fun and instructional to watch. You realise how much effort goes into each mouthful you enjoy. The prices for items are often quoted in 10s which if you are on your own or in a couple may seem excessive. If you ask nicely they will definitely do them in 5s and if you are very nice they may even give them in singles, although I get the impression this is not encouraged. To be honest even though this is probably one of the more costly restaurants by Taiwan standards, by western standards it is still remarkably good value. If you order 10 and don't eat them all, it won't really impact your wallet.The food is excellent, tasty, fresh and filling. Tea is free, and you can choose beer which went down nicely.The whole place has a very positive, energetic and happy atmosphere. The staff seemed purposeful, and there were plenty of what looked like genuine smiles. There are a good number of locals eating here, so although it is clearly on the tourist list it is obviously doing something right.I'm not sure I'd choose it for a romantic dinner, but great for meeting friends or colleagues and having a good chat over good food. And if you are going up into the Taipei 101 observatory this is an excellent choice and very good value.One tip it closes at about 21","30, so don't leave it too late to arrive. I didn't need to book, just turned up (about 20","15), but if you are eating earlier in the evening I'm guessing you may need to make a reservation.\",,,,,2011/9/20," Being in China for a year now, I always look for great service since its almost none existant. The staff at Din Tai Fung was very attentive which just added to a very pleasant experience.Do not forget to order the crab roe dumpling as well as the pork dumpling. The simple sauce (vinigar, soy sauce, and ginger) made it very tasty.\",,,,,,,2011/9/5," Definitely will advice to all the couples visiting Taipei to have a dinner there. It's one of the most romantic restaurants I've ever visited. We even didn't make any reservation, just went there and were sited near the window with a breathtaking view. I loved it so so much...\",,,,,,,2011/8/17," The ambience is solid, once can watch the dumpling production process through glass windows, and the waitresses look more like airline personnel.The dumplings are very good, I took the prawn and something variety. The noodle soup (beef but without beef pieces) was subtle in its taste, focussing attention on taste and texture of the noodles rather then the embedding liquid. I also had the small sesame buns as a dessert. Delicious, too, but one o two are enough as the taste is very strong.If hungry and in the Taipei 101 area, do not miss out on the place!\",,,,,,,2018/9/9, 101\uc0\u12395 \'a4\'57\u12387 \u12383 \'ab\'e1\'a1\'42\'a4\'70\'b8\'a1\u12364 \u12377 \u12365 \'a7\'51\'a5\'ce\u12375 \u12424 \u12358 \u12392 \'ab\'e4\u12387 \u12383 \u12425 \u12458 \u12540 \u12480 \u12540 \u12473 \u12488 \u12483 \u12503 \u12398 \'ae\'c9\'b6\'a1\u12395 \'a1\'43\'a5\'4b\'a4\'e8\u12394 \u12367 \u12486 \u12452 \u12463 \u12450 \u12454 \u12488 \u12391 \'c1\'ca\'a4\'4a\u12375 \'a1\'42\u12507 \u12486 \u12523 \u12391 \'ad\'b9\u12377 \u12371 \u12392 \u12395 \'a1\'43\'a7\'4e\u12417 \u12427 \u12392 \'a5\'bb\u26469 \u12398 \'ad\'b7\'a8\'fd\u12364 \'b7\'6c\u12394 \u12431 \u12428 \'a1\'5d\u24403 \'b5\'4d\u12384 \u12364 \'a1\'5e\u12362 \'dc\'60\u12392 \'a5\'cd\'ab\'b8\u12399 \u12388 \u12356 \u12390 \u12356 \u12383 \u12364 \u12362 \u37284 \'aa\'6f\u12364 \u12394 \u12363 \u12387 \u12383 \'a1\'43\u12507 \u12486 \u12523 \u12391 \u12362 \'c4\'40\u12356 \u12377 \u12427 \u12395 \u12418 \'ad\'b1\'ad\'cb\u12384 \u12387 \u12383 \u12398 \u12391 \u12381 \u12398 \u12414 \u12414 \'ad\'b9\u12409 \u12383 \'a1\'43\'af\'ba\u12356 \'b8\'dc\'aa\'ba\u12394 \'ab\'e4\u12356 \'a5\'58\u12395 \u12394 \u12387 \u12383 \'a1\'43\,,,,,,,2011/12/11, The dumplings are seriously good and what's even better is that you can grab this on route to the observatory for Taipei 101.

I didn't need to book, just turned up (about 20","15), but if you are eating earlier in the evening I'm guessing you may need to make a reservation.\",,,,,2011/9/20," Being in China for a year now, I always look for great service since its almost none existant. The staff at Din Tai Fung was very attentive which just added to a very pleasant experience.Do not forget to order the crab roe dumpling as well as the pork dumpling. The simple sauce (vinigar, soy sauce, and ginger) made it very tasty.\",,,,,,,2011/9/5," Definitely will advice to all the couples visiting Taipei to have a dinner there. It's one of the most romantic restaurants I've ever visited. We even didn't make any reservation, just went there and were sited near the window with a breathtaking view. I loved it so so much...\",,,,,,,2011/8/17," The ambience is solid, once can watch the dumpling production process through glass windows, and the waitresses look more like airline personnel.The dumplings are very good, I took the prawn and something variety. The noodle soup (beef but without beef pieces) was subtle in its taste, focussing attention on taste and texture of the noodles rather then the embedding liquid. I also had the small sesame buns as a dessert. Delicious, too, but one o two are enough as the taste is very strong.If hungry and in the Taipei 101 area, do not miss out on the place!\",,,,,,,
