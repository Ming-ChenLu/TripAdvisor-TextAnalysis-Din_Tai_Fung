Analysis on 3937 reviews

The purpose of the analysis is to examine customers' preferences of restaurant based on food, service, and value dimensions.

I've scraped down 3937 restaurant reviews from TripAdvisor dating from 12th Oct, 2011 to 10th Sep, 2018. Taking three  outsource text as training text, I then perform naive Bayes classification to classify reviews into each of the dimension. Sentiment analysis was also conducted for the reviews. Afterward, analysis was focus on seeing any change of dimensions overtime.
